Bacteria , consuming too much alcohol , certain medications , chronic stress , or other immune system problems can lead to inflammation .
And it can increase your risk of vitamin deficiencies , anemia , and cancer.
But people who do have symptoms often experience : upper abdominal pain , indigestion , bloating , nausea , vomiting , belching , loss of appetite , weight loss , .
The following can irritate the lining of your stomach and lead to chronic gastritis : long-term use of certain medications , such as aspirin and ibuprofen , excessive alcohol consumption , the presence of H. pylori bacteria , certain illnesses , such as diabetes or kidney failure , a weakened immune system , persistent , intense stress that also affects the immune system , bile flowing into the stomach , or bile reflux , .
Get medical help right away if any of the following occur : vomiting blood , rapid heartbeat , difficulty breathing or swallowing , extreme drowsiness , passing out suddenly , confusion , .
Chronic gastritis puts you at risk for bleeding in your stomach and small intestine .
It can cause severe and nagging pain .
However , the pain is temporary and usually lasts for short bursts at a time .
Acute gastritis comes on suddenly , and can be caused by injury , bacteria , viruses , stress , or ingesting irritants such as alcohol , NSAIDs , steroids , or spicy food .
Chronic gastritis might cause more of a consistent dull ache than the more intense pain of acute gastritis .
Gastritis only directly affects the stomach and may include nausea or vomiting , while gastroenteritis affects both the stomach and the intestines .
Gastroenteritis symptoms may include diarrhea in addition to nausea or vomiting .
It ’ s often the cause of peptic ulcers .
When a person can not absorb enough B-12 , they may develop pernicious anemia .
Pernicious anemia is a complication that makes it difficult for a person to create red blood cells .
Left untreated , it will get worse over time and can lead to stomach ulcers .
However , most people with chronic gastritis experience a variety of symptoms , including : indigestion , a burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach , the sensation of being full after eating a small amount , nausea and vomiting , belching , unintentional weight loss , bloating , loss of appetite , upper abdominal pain or discomfort , bleeding , usually only in erosive gastritis , Gastritis is termed erosive if the stomach lining has been worn away , exposing the tissue to stomach acids.
Causes of this include : overuse or long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , such as ibuprofen and naproxen , excessive alcohol consumption , chronic stress , injuries and impact , exposure to radiation , recurring bile reflux from the small intestine , cocaine use , .
Possible risk factors for chronic gastritis include : diets high in salt or preservatives , diets high in fat and oil , especially saturated and trans fats , smoking , long-term consumption of alcohol , conditions that weaken the immune system , cocaine use , long-term use of NSAIDs and some other medications , long-term use of medications for acid reflux and indigestion , .
Erosive gastritis can cause peptic ulcers .
Severe ulcers may eventually cause internal bleeding , which can be life-threatening if left untreated .
During treatment people may develop fever , headache , and muscle pains , a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer .
In the classic form , it evolves from a macule to a papule and finally to an erosion or ulcer .
There may be a symmetrical , reddish-pink , non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities , including the palms and soles .
Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing , you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body — even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet .
This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wart-like sores in the mouth or genital area .
Some people also experience hair loss , muscle aches , a fever , sore throat and swollen lymph nodes .
Later symptoms may include deafness , teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses .
Syphilis can cause a number of problems with your nervous system , including : Stroke , Meningitis , Hearing loss , Visual problems , Dementia , Loss of pain and temperature sensations , Sexual dysfunction in men ( impotence ) , Bladder incontinence , Sudden , lightning-like pains , .
Adults with sexually transmitted syphilis or other genital ulcers have an estimated two- to fivefold increased risk of contracting HIV .
Vagina , Symptom Checker , Muscle pain , .
Syphilis was once a major public health threat , commonly causing serious long-term health problems such as arthritis , brain damage , and blindness .
They may also experience moist warts in the groin , white patches on the inside of the mouth , swollen lymph glands , fever , and weight loss .
If the infection is n't treated , it may then progress to a stage characterized by severe problems with the heart , brain , and nerves that can result in paralysis , blindness , dementia , deafness , impotence , and even death if it 's not treated .
If syphilis is left untreated , it can cause serious and permanent problems such as dementia , blindness , or death .
Secondary syphilis symptoms include : a non-itchy rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the entire body , including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet .
It may be rough , red , or reddish-brown in color , oral , anal , and genital wart-like sores , muscle aches , fever , sore throat , swollen lymph nodes , patchy hair loss , headaches , weight loss , fatigue , .
Symptoms include : dementia or altered mental status , abnormal gait , numbness in the extremities , problems with concentration , confusion , headache or seizures , vision problems or vision loss , weakness , .
Adverse outcomes include early fetal death , preterm or low birth weight , neonatal deaths , and infection in infants .
Symptoms in newborns include : saddle nose , in which the bridge of the nose is missing , fever , difficulty gaining weight , a rash of the genitals , anus , and mouth , small blisters on the hands and feet that change to a copper-colored rash and spread to the face , which can be bumpy or flat , watery nasal fluid , .
Older infants and young children may experience : Hutchinson teeth , or abnormal , peg-shaped teeth , bone pain , vision loss , hearing loss , joint swelling , saber shins , a bone problem in the lower legs , scarring of the skin around the genitals , anus , and mouth , gray patches around the outer vagina and anus , .
, Cerebrospinal fluid : This may be collected through a spinal tap and examined to test for any impact on the nervous system.
Chills , fever , nausea , achy pain , and a headache may occur on the first day of treatment .
Secondary syphilis is characterized by a skin rash that typically does not itch and may easily be mistaken for rashes caused by other illnesses .
The rash of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet , which is unusual for most rashes .
In some people , the rash may be mild and not noticed .
Fever , enlarged lymph nodes , fatigue , weight loss , hair loss , headaches , and muscle aches have all been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis .
Symptoms that can result from the late stage of syphilis include problems with movement , gradual loss of sight , dementia , paralysis , and numbness .
If infected babies are born and survive , they are at risk for serious problems including seizures and developmental delays .
Some of the better known complications of late syphilis include blindness , dementia , aortic aneurysm , deafness , stroke , and other complications related to spread of the infection to the brain .

Skin rashes and a sore throat may develop during the second stage of syphilis .
The rash won ’ t itch and is usually found on the palms and soles , but it may occur anywhere on the body .
Some people don ’ t notice the rash before it goes away .
Other symptoms of secondary syphilis may include : headaches , swollen lymph nodes , fatigue , fever , weight loss , hair loss , aching joints , .
Some other potential outcomes of tertiary syphilis include : blindness , deafness , mental illness , memory loss , destruction of soft tissue and bone , neurological disorders , such as stroke or meningitis , heart disease , neurosyphilis , which is an infection of the brain or spinal cord , .
If your doctor suspects that you ’ re having nervous system problems because of tertiary syphilis , you may need a lumbar puncture , or spinal tap .
The bacteria can be killed , but treatment will most likely focus on easing pain and discomfort .
Babies born with congenital syphilis can also have the following : deformities , developmental delays , seizures , rashes , fever , swollen liver or spleen , anemia , jaundice , infectious sores , .
The disease can be transmitted from any contact with one of the ulcers , which are teeming with spirochetes .
This phase can include hair loss ; a sore throat ; white patches in the nose , mouth , and vagina ; fever ; headaches ; and a skin rash .
These wart-like lesions , as well as the skin rash , are highly contagious .
The rash can occur on the palms of the hands , and the infection can be transmitted by casual contact.
The ABCs of Skin Cancer , Aging and Addiction , Penis Curved When Erect , Allergy Relief for Your Family , .
Other generalized symptoms include fever , sore throat , enlargement of the lymph nodes , and headaches .
Another neurologic disorder , tabes dorsalis , or locomotor ataxia , is produced by degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord ; it brings on intense back pain , lack of muscular coordination , and wasting .
If congenital syphilis is not treated , blindness , deafness , perforation of the palate , inflammation of the liver , and involvement of the central nervous system may ensue .
However , in curing late-stage syphilis , nothing can repair the neurologic or other damage already caused by the spirochetes .
In its early stages , the great pox produced a rash similar to smallpox ( also known as variola ) .
The ulcers suffered by British soldiers in Portugal were termed The Black Lion .
Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth .
If it 's suspected that you have nervous system complications of syphilis , your doctor may also suggest collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid through a procedure called a lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) .
Signs and symptoms include a fever , chills , nausea , achy pain and headache .

Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration .
In most cases , symptoms include fever , chills , loss of appetite , nausea , muscle pains particularly in the back , and headaches .
In about 15 % of people within a day of improving , the fever comes back , abdominal pain occurs , and liver damage begins causing yellow skin .
In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon , early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population are important to prevent outbreaks .
In 2013 , yellow fever resulted in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths , with nearly 90 % of these occurring in African nations .
Since the 1980s , the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing .
In the 18th and 19th centuries , yellow fever was seen as one of the most dangerous infectious diseases .
Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days .
Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever , headache , chills , back pain , fatigue , loss of appetite , muscle pain , nausea , and vomiting .
In 15 % of cases , however , people enter a second , toxic phase of the disease with recurring fever , this time accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage , as well as abdominal pain .
Bleeding in the mouth , the eyes , and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood , hence the Spanish name for yellow fever , vómito negro ( black vomit ) .
There may also be kidney failure , hiccups , and delirium .
Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus , a 40– to 50-nm-wide enveloped RNA virus , the type species and namesake of the family Flaviviridae .
After entering the host cell , the viral genome is replicated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and in the so-called vesicle packets .
The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa .
Because of this sylvatic cycle , yellow fever can not be eradicated .
Concern exists about yellow fever spreading to southeast Asia , where its vector A. aegypti already occurs .
Fatality may occur when cytokine storm , shock , and multiple organ failure follow .
Yellow fever is most frequently a clinical diagnosis , made on the basis of symptoms and the infected person 's whereabouts prior to becoming ill .
Since mild courses of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks , every suspected case of yellow fever ( involving symptoms of fever , pain , nausea , and vomiting 6-10 days after leaving the affected area ) is treated seriously .
If yellow fever is suspected , the virus can not be confirmed until 6-10 days after the illness .
Serologically , an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during the acute phase of the disease using specific IgM against yellow fever or an increase in specific IgG titer ( compared to an earlier sample ) can confirm yellow fever .
Together with clinical symptoms , the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever .
In a differential diagnosis , infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as malaria .
Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes .
Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever .
Adult mosquitos can be killed through insecticide spray usage , which decreases the transmission of yellow fever .
In rare cases ( less than one in 200,000 to 300,000 ) , the vaccination can cause yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease , which is fatal in 60 % of cases .
Another possible side effect is an infection of the nervous system , which occurs in one in 200,000 to 300,000 cases , causing yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease , which can lead to meningoencephalitis and is fatal in less than 5 % of cases .
According to the WHO , mass vaccination can not eliminate yellow fever because of the vast number of infected mosquitoes in urban areas of the target countries , but it will significantly reduce the number of people infected .
Similar efforts may be effective against yellow fever .
As for other flavivirus infections , no cure is known for yellow fever .
Acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect , which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever .
Yellow fever is common in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa .
The historical record shows an outbreak of yellow fever occurred in Recife , Brazil , between 1685 and 1690 .
It began as an outbreak in brown howler monkeys , which serve as a sentinel species for yellow fever , that then spread to men working in the jungle .
By the end of May the outbreak appeared to be declining after more than 3,000 suspected cases , 758 confirmed and 264 deaths confirmed to be yellow fever .
Though the main vector ( A. aegypti ) also occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia , the Pacific , and Australia , yellow fever has never occurred in these parts of the globe until the introduction of 11 cases by jet travel from an outbreak in Africa in 2016 .
The evolutionary origins of yellow fever most likely lie in Africa , with transmission of the disease from nonhuman primates to humans .
When an outbreak of yellow fever would occur in an African village where colonists resided , most Europeans died , while the native population usually suffered nonlethal symptoms resembling influenza .
The first definitive outbreak of yellow fever in the New World was in 1647 on the island of Barbados .
The first mention of the disease by the name yellow fever occurred in 1744 .
McNeill argues that the environmental and ecological disruption caused by the introduction of sugar plantations created the conditions for mosquito and viral reproduction , and subsequent outbreaks of yellow fever .
In Colonial times and during the Napoleonic Wars , the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area .
The mortality rate in British garrisons in Jamaica was seven times that of garrisons in Canada , mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases such as malaria .
The historian J. R. McNeill asserts that yellow fever accounted for about 35,000 to 45,000 casualties of these forces during the fighting .
In 1853 , Cloutierville , Louisiana , had a late-summer outbreak of yellow fever that quickly killed 68 of the 91 inhabitants .
650 residents of Savannah , Georgia died from yellow fever in 1854 .
In 1873 , Shreveport , Louisiana , lost almost a quarter of its population to yellow fever .
The result was a huge epidemic of yellow fever .
The steamship John D. Porter took people fleeing Memphis northward in hopes of escaping the disease , but passengers were not allowed to disembark due to concerns of spreading yellow fever .
Mars had an uncommonly dense atmosphere , but its inhabitants were probably protected from the fever by their newly discovered canals , which were perhaps made to absorb carbon and prevent the disease .
In 1848 , Josiah C. Nott suggested that yellow fever was spread by insects such as moths or mosquitoes , basing his ideas on the pattern of transmission of the disease .
Carlos Finlay , a Cuban doctor and scientist , proposed in 1881 that yellow fever might be transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct human contact .
Since the losses from yellow fever in the Spanish–American War in the 1890s were extremely high , Army doctors began research experiments with a team led by Walter Reed , and composed of doctors James Carroll , Aristides Agramonte , and Jesse William Lazear .
Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes .
He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal .
A previous effort of canal building by the French had failed ( in part due to mortality from the high incidence of yellow fever and malaria , which killed many workers ) .
Although Dr. Walter Reed has received much of the credit in United States history books for beating yellow fever , he had fully credited Dr. Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector , and how it might be controlled .
Reed 's research was essential in the fight against yellow fever .
Like Cuba and Panama , Brazil also led a highly successful sanitation campaign against mosquitoes and yellow fever .
The eradication of yellow fever strengthened the relationship between the US and Mexico , which had not been very good in the past .
The eradication of yellow fever was also a major step toward better global health .
Using vector control and strict vaccination programs , the urban cycle of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America .
With few countries establishing regular vaccination programs , measures to fight yellow fever have been neglected , making the future spread of the virus more likely .
In the hamster model of yellow fever , early administration of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease .
Yellow fever has been researched by several countries as a potential biological weapon .
The term yellow fever appears on p. 186 .

The symptoms of yellow fever include fever , headache , and muscle aches , with some patients going on to develop life-threatening complications.
Yellow fever is an acute viral infectious disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes .
Though many cases of yellow fever are mild and self-limiting , yellow fever can also be a life-threatening disease causing hemorrhagic fever and hepatitis ( hence the term yellow from the jaundice it can cause ) .
An increase in the number of cases of yellow fever in the last few decades has led to campaigns aimed at improving public awareness and disease prevention for this re-emerging infectious disease .
During the late 18th century , a severe yellow fever outbreak struck New England and several North American port cities .
In the late 19th century , Dr. Carlos Finlay , a Cuban physician , first proposed the theory that a mosquito transmits yellow fever .
It was not until 1900 , using earlier research from Dr. Finlay as a foundation , that U.S. Army Major Dr. Walter Reed and his team proved that mosquitoes , in fact , transmit yellow fever .
This groundbreaking idea was instrumental in leading to the subsequent control of yellow fever in various regions .
This successful vaccine helped control and eliminate yellow fever from various countries in Africa and South America during the mid-20th century .
Unfortunately , yellow fever has had a large outbreak of the disease that began in 2017 and has spread to several Brazilian states .
A virus causes yellow fever .
Tissue damage to the liver , for example , can lead to jaundice and disrupt the body 's blood-clotting mechanism , leading to the hemorrhagic complications sometimes seen with yellow fever .
The bite of infected mosquitoes transmits yellow fever to humans .
There are three transmission cycles for yellow fever .
Yellow fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of both Africa and South America , though an estimated 90 % of the worldwide reported infections occur in Africa .
The bite of infected mosquitoes ( for example , Haemagogus leucocelaenus and/or Aedes serratus mosquitoes ) transmits yellow fever to humans .
Direct contact with other infected individuals does not transmit yellow fever .
Humans with yellow fever are infectious and can transmit the virus to uninfected mosquitoes shortly before the onset of fever and for three to five days after the onset of symptoms .
A variety of specialists may become involved in the care of patients who develop symptoms of yellow fever .
Initially , primary care physicians , including family physicians , internists , emergency physicians , and pediatricians , may encounter patients with yellow fever .
Infectious-disease specialists care for individuals diagnosed with yellow fever , as well .
Patients with yellow fever may see other specialists depending on the severity of their illness and the development of complications ( for example , a nephrologist in cases of kidney failure ) .
After infection with the yellow fever virus , many individuals will experience no clinically apparent manifestations of the mosquito-borne disease ( asymptomatic ) , while others will go on to develop a mild , self-limiting flu-like illness characterized by the following symptoms and signs : Fever , Chills , Generalized muscle pain , Back pain , Headache , Malaise , Weakness , HIV , Nausea , Vomiting , .
In addition to the above symptoms , the following symptoms and signs may also develop : Abdominal pain , Prevention , Bleeding from the gums , nose , eyes , and/or stomach , Blood in the stool and blood in the vomit , Easy bruising of the skin , Kidney failure , Confusion , Seizures , Coma , .
Bacterial Infections 101 Pictures Slideshow Take the Tummy Trouble Quiz Hepatitis C Slideshow Pictures Because the symptoms during the initial phase of yellow fever are nonspecific and similar to a flu-like illness , diagnosis during this stage can be difficult .
Various blood test abnormalities may be present in individuals with yellow fever , particularly those who go on to develop the second toxic phase of the disease .
None of these test results is specific to yellow fever and alone allow the health care provider to make a diagnosis .
The laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever requires specialized testing .
Blood tests may demonstrate the presence of virus-specific antibodies ( IgM and IgG ) produced by the immune system in response to the infection , though cross-reactivity with antibodies from other flaviviruses may occur .
There is no specific curative treatment for yellow fever .
Treatment is supportive and aimed at relieving the symptoms of the disease , including the pain and fever .
As previously mentioned , the majority of patients who do develop symptoms from yellow fever will experience a mild course of illness that will resolve on its own .
Supportive measures implemented depend on the severity of the disease , and may include oxygen administration , , intravenous fluid administration for dehydration , , medications to increase blood pressure in cases of circulatory collapse , , transfusion of blood products in cases of severe bleeding , , antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections , , dialysis for kidney failure , and , endotracheal intubation ( placement of a breathing tube ) and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure.
Bacterial Infections 101 Pictures Slideshow Take the Tummy Trouble Quiz Hepatitis C Slideshow Pictures For individuals with yellow fever who develop the acute mild course of the illness , the symptoms will generally last about three to four days , and most patients will recover fully .
The prognosis for individuals who develop uncomplicated yellow fever is generally excellent .
However , for those patients who go on to develop the toxic phase of yellow fever , case-fatality rates range from 20 % -50 % depending on the underlying condition of the patient and the availability of supportive resources .
In those individuals who survive yellow fever , generally there is no residual permanent organ damage .
Vaccination remains the most effective way of preventing yellow fever .
It provides immunity ( boosts the immune system ) against yellow fever in 95 % of individuals within one week of its administration .
Health care providers recommended vaccination for travelers going to areas where yellow fever is endemic ( at least 10 days before going to the area ) and to vaccinate local populations who are at risk .
Effective mosquito-control measures are also an important component for preventing or minimizing the risk of yellow fever .
Health care providers need to consider the individual 's underlying health , their risk of exposure to yellow fever , and the contraindications to vaccine administration before recommending it .
Individuals who do experience side effects from the yellow fever vaccine will generally experience mild symptoms , including low-grade fever , muscle aches , and headache .

 The Flavivirus causes yellow fever .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate that in 2013 , there were between 84,000 severe cases of yellow fever and between 29,000 and 60,000 fatalities .
Here are some key points about cold yellow fever .
Mosquitoes spread yellow fever .
If a mosquito bites a monkey that has the fever , they can pass it to humans .
Yellow fever can occur in settlements close to the jungle , where infected monkeys and mosquitoes live , and it can spread from there .
Most people with yellow fever do not develop symptoms , or the symptoms are very mild .
Yellow fever has an incubation period of between 3 and 6 days , so it takes from 3 to 6 days for signs and symptoms to appear after a person is infected .
The main symptoms of yellow fever are a high temperature , a slow pulse , albuminuria , jaundice , congestion of the face , and hemorrhage , or bleeding .
Signs and symptoms are categorized into two stages : In the early , acute stage , the individual may experience : aching muscles , particularly the back and knees , a high fever , dizziness , a headache , loss of appetite , nausea , shivers , or chills , vomiting , .
These include : recurring fever , abdominal pain , vomiting , sometimes with blood , tiredness , sluggishness , lethargy , jaundice , which gives the skin and whites of the eyes a yellow tinge , kidney failure , liver failure , hemorrhage , delirium , seizures , and sometimes coma , arrhythmias , or irregular heartbeats , bleeding from the nose , mouth , and eyes , .
Within 7 to 10 days , yellow fever is fatal in around half of all people who enter the toxic phase .
A flavivirus causes yellow fever .
There is no effective antiviral medication to treat yellow fever , so treatment consists of supportive care in a hospital .
In 2014 , a study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases reported that changes in white blood cells could signal an early sign of fatal yellow fever .
In the past , yellow fever devastated communities , including those in the United States ( U.S. ) and Europe .
In the middle of the 20th century , scientists developed a safe and effective vaccine that prevents yellow fever .
Side effects may include : headaches , low-grade fevers , muscle pain , tiredness , soreness at the injection site , in very rare cases , infants and older people may develop more serious reactions , such as encephalitis , .
Most people do not develop symptoms , but those who do may experience weakness and tiredness for several months .
What 's to know about yellow fever ?
Yellow fever , acute infectious disease , one of the great epidemic diseases of the tropical world , though it sometimes has occurred in temperate zones as well .
Yellow fever appears with a sudden onset of fever , chills , headache , backache , nausea , and vomiting .
The skin and eyes may appear yellow—a condition known as jaundice and a sign that gives rise to the disease ’ s popular name .
There is no specific treatment for those with yellow fever beyond good nursing and supportive care .
However , yellow fever is an outstanding example of a completely preventable disease .
Western Africa has long been regarded as the home of yellow fever , although the first recorded outbreaks of the disease were in central and coastal South America after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century .
For the next 300 years , yellow fever , given various names such as Yellow Jack and “ the saffron scourge , ” was one of the great plagues of the New World .
By the late 19th century there were several theories about the cause and transmission of yellow fever .
Treatment consisted of “ vigorous measures ” to purge the infection : doses of ipecacuanha to induce vomiting , castor oil to loosen the bowels , and enemas of cold water with turpentine to expel gas .
In 1881 Cuban epidemiologist Carlos Juan Finlay suggested that yellow fever was caused by an infectious agent transmitted by a mosquito now known as Aedes aegypti .
In his investigation of Finlay ’ s theory , U.S. Army pathologist and bacteriologist Major Walter Reed demonstrated in 1900 the transmission of yellow fever from one human to another through the bite of A. aegypti .
The last outbreak of yellow fever in the United States occurred in 1905 , when New Orleans , Louisiana , and other ports of the South were invaded .
In 1927 researchers from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , working in West Africa and the United States , demonstrated that yellow fever was transmitted by a specific virus , and over the next decade a vaccine was developed from attenuated strains of the virus ( an achievement for which Rockefeller researcher Max Theiler eventually won a Nobel Prize ) .
Since then , ravaging epidemics have not broken out as in the past ; nevertheless , the World Health Organization estimates that some 30,000 people die each year in areas where yellow fever is endemic .
The course of yellow fever is rapid .
The onset of symptoms is then abrupt , with headache , backache , rapidly rising fever , nausea , and vomiting .
This acute stage lasts two or three days , after which the patient either begins to recover or proceeds to a deeper toxic state marked by high fever , slow pulse rate , and the vomiting of dark blood .
Because the virus destroys liver cells , jaundice ( yellowing of the skin and eyes by deposition of bile pigment ) is a common sign in persons with yellow fever .
In the early stages of yellow fever , its symptoms are similar to those of other tropical fevers such as malaria , leptospirosis , or dengue .
Treatment is supportive and is designed to correct the acid–base imbalance and electrolyte abnormalities caused by vomiting , heart failure , and kidney derangements .
Good nursing and supportive care , particularly in reducing fever , are important both in maintaining comfort and in reducing mortality .
Still , control of mosquito populations is an essential component of any program designed to prevent the spread of yellow fever , particularly in urban areas .
In these regions , human cases will continue as long as there remain unimmunized persons , for there is no known practical way of eliminating the virus of yellow fever from the animal and mosquito populations of the vast tropical forests in South America and Africa .

Untreated babies may become developmentally delayed , have seizures , or die .
The rash may become maculopapular or pustular .
Other symptoms may include fever , sore throat , malaise , weight loss , hair loss , and headache .
Common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include enlargement of the liver and spleen ( 70 % ) , rash ( 70 % ) , fever ( 40 % ) , neurosyphilis ( 20 % ) , and lung inflammation ( 20 % ) .
It frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours , with symptoms of fever , muscle pains , headache , and a fast heart rate .
Other possible complications of chronic gastritis include : anemia caused by iron deficiency , anemia caused by internal bleeding , vitamin B-12 deficiency , abnormal stomach growths , such as polyps and tumors , .
Signs of internal bleeding can include : dizziness , unexplained weakness , paleness , black , tarry stools , red , fresh-looking blood in the stool , red blood in vomit or vomiting blood , unexplained drowsiness , difficulty breathing or swallowing , confusion , passing out , .
Antacids can sometimes cause constipation or diarrhea and other side effects.
Common lifestyle changes recommended for people with chronic gastritis include : quitting smoking , avoiding or reducing the use of NSAIDs , sometimes by talking to a doctor about other medications , practicing good food and personal hygiene , including washing the hands frequently , exercising regularly , drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated , managing stress and pain with relaxation techniques and practices , such as meditation , yoga , controlled breathing , and acupuncture , .
Chronic gastritis can cause pain and discomfort and lead to serious complications if left untreated .
Management of chronic gastritis involves treating any underlying conditions , taking medications to counteract stomach acid , and making lifestyle and dietary changes .
When a bacterial infection is the cause of atrophic gastritis , a person may notice symptoms that include : unusual or unintended weight loss , vomiting , lack of appetite , nausea , iron deficiency anemia , pain in the stomach , ulcers , .
When autoimmune atrophic gastritis is the cause , a person may notice symptoms of a vitamin B-12 deficiency and pernicious anemia .
Symptoms include : pain in the chest , general fatigue , tinnitus or ringing in the ears , dizziness , lightheadedness , heart palpitations , .
If this occurs , a person may notice : confusion , unsteadiness when walking , tingling or numbness in the arms or legs , .
The physical exam usually involves the doctor feeling around the stomach region to check for tenderness .
Often , the doctor will also order blood tests to look for : lowered levels of B-12 , low levels of pepsinogen , a protein that stomach cells produce , antibodies that are attacking intrinsic factor or stomach cells , higher levels of the hormone that produces stomach acid called gastrin , .
While it ’ s unclear how H. pylori spreads , it can result in stomach inflammation , loss of appetite , nausea , bloating , and abdominal pain .
Common symptoms include : loss of appetite , indigestion , black stools , nausea , vomiting , bloody vomit that looks like used coffee grounds , pain in the upper part of the abdomen , a full feeling in the upper abdomen after eating , .
There are some conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of acute gastritis , including : peptic ulcers , which may accompany gastritis , Crohn ’ s disease , which is a chronic inflammatory condition and can involve the entire digestive tract , gallstones or gallbladder disease , food poisoning , which can cause severe abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea , .
Lean meats like chicken or turkey breast can be added to the diet if tolerated , though chicken broth or other soups might be best if vomiting keeps happening .

Abdominal pain can be crampy , achy , dull , intermittent or sharp .
It causes severe , temporary pain .
People with gastritis frequently experience abdominal pain .
Pain is often located in the upper-center part of the abdomen , or in the upper-left portion of the stomach .
Pain will often radiate to the back .
Other common symptoms include bloating and nausea .
Vomiting blood is a symptom of more severe gastritis .
Other symptoms of severe gastritis include shortness of breath , chest pain , severe stomach pain , and foul-smelling bowel movements .
Seek urgent medical evaluation if any of the following symptoms occur : vomiting blood , bringing up excessive amounts of yellow or green vomit , black or bloody bowel movements , abdominal pain with fever , dizziness and fainting , rapid heartbeat , excessive sweating , shortness of breath , .
Stomach bleeding and ulcers can occur in people with gastritis who are yet to be treated .
Both types can develop into anemia .
Ménétrier disease : This disorder is rare and involves the development of thick folds and cysts on the stomach wall.
Risk factors for gastritis include : bacterial infections , especially H. pylori infection , viral , fungal , or parasitic infections , smoking , caffeine intake , excessive alcohol intake , cocaine use , stress , routine use of pain medications , such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications ( NSAIDs ) , regularly taking medications such as prescription steroids , chemotherapy , potassium supplements , and iron , being an older adult , swallowing corrosives or foreign objects , having an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto 's disease or type 1 diabetes , vitamin B12 deficiency , HIV , Crohn 's disease , bile reflux after undergoing stomach surgery , a history of chronic vomiting , exposure to radiation , either by radioactive treatment or contamination , food allergies , .
Although many individuals with gastritis may have no symptoms , both acute and chronic gastritis may have symptoms ofabdominal pain , , nausea , , vomiting , and , occasionally , belching , bloating , loss of appetite and indigestion.
Complications from chronic gastritis include peptic ulcer , bleeding ulcers , anemia , gastric cancers , MALT lymphoma , renal problems , strictures , bowel obstruction , or even death.

Symptoms of gastritis include : Upper abdominal pain , Burning , Heartburn , .
Symptoms of chronic gastritis include : Feelings of fullness , Nausea , Intestinal gas , .
This has leads to some confusion and is the reason why many health-care professionals now consider the term gastritis as a non-specific description of a cluster of symptoms .
Indigestion ( dyspepsia ) is another term that encompasses this cluster of symptoms .
Symptoms of severe gastritis may include : Vomiting blood , Blood in the stool , Anemia , .
Complications of gastritis may include peptic ulcer , , bleeding ulcers , , erosive stomach lining ( the stomach tissue wears away ) , anemia , , gastric cancers , , MALT lymphoma , , gastric scarring and strictures with outlet obstruction , , dehydration , , renal problems , and , death.
The prognosis of individuals with chronic disease and those who develop serious complications like bleeding ulcers , obstruction and cancer is more guarded .

Here , we observed tumour‐associated TLSs in a preclinical mouse model ( gp130 ) of gastric cancer , where tumourigenesis is dependent on hyperactive STAT3 signalling through the common IL‐6 family signalling receptor , gp130 .
Gastric tumourigenesis was associated with the development of B and T cell‐rich submucosal lymphoid aggregates , containing CD21 cellular networks and high endothelial venules .
Recently , tumour‐associated TLSs were described in GC , and histological evidence of a coordinated local B cell ( CD20 ) and T helper ( Th ) 1 ( T‐bet ) response was associated with improved relapse‐free survival .
At the molecular level , these mice contain a knock‐in phenylalanine mutation at tyrosine 757 in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 , the common IL‐6 family signalling receptor , disrupts the negative feedback imposed on gp130 signalling by suppressor of cytokine signalling ( SOCS ) 3 .
The gp130 mice and their compound mutant derivatives either heterozygous for Stat3 ( gp130 : Stat3± ) or deficient in Il17a ( gp130 : Il17a ) , have been described previously.
Submucosal lymphoid aggregates were characterised in serial sections by immunohistochemistry , using antibodies specific to mouse B220 ( BD Biosciences , UK ) , CD3 ( Dako , Agilent Technologies , UK ) , podoplanin ( BioLegend , UK ) , p‐YSTAT3 ( Cell Signaling Technology , from New England BioLabs , UK ) , CD21 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Germany ) , CXCL13 ( R & D Systems , UK ) , PNAd ( MECA‐79 ) , Bcl‐6 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and Ki67 ( Abcam , UK ) .
Lymphoid aggregates in human GC biopsies were detected using antibodies against CD20 and CD3 ( both from Dako ) .

[ Color figure can be viewed at ] Cytokines that activate STAT3 have previously been linked with TLS development and maintenance , including IL‐6 , IL‐21 and IL‐22.
Development of tumour‐associated TLSs in gp130 mice is STAT3 driven but is independent of IL‐17 .
H & E and immunohistochemistry for B cells ( B220 ) and T cells ( CD3 ) in tumour‐associated TLSs of 6‐month‐old gp130 ( WT ) , gp130 ( FF ) , gp130 : Stat3 ( FF : St3 ) and gp130 : IL17a ( FF : Il17 ) mice ( representative images from n = 6 gp130 , n = 5 gp130 , n = 4 gp130 : IL17a , n = 4 gp130 : Stat3 ) .
The IL‐6 related cytokine , IL‐27 , also utilises gp130 for signalling .
However while IL‐6 is primarily pro‐inflammatory , IL‐27 can preferentially activate STAT1 to exert suppressive effects on adaptive immune cells .
Amongst the factors associated with treatment failure are high bacterial load , high gastric acidity , Hp strain , smoking , low compliance , overweight , and increasing antibiotic resistance .
A systematic review showed , in AG patients with pernicious anaemia , an estimated 7-fold relative risk of gastric cancer [ ] .
From a gastroenterological perspective , bismuth salts have been used to treat peptic ulcer disease , dyspepsia , parasitic infections , microscopic colitis , and infectious diarrhoea [ ] .
There was also no statistically significant difference in the total number of adverse events between those receiving bismuth salts and other regimens or in the individual adverse events , that is , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , dizziness , headache , metallic taste , nausea or vomiting .
This phenomenon is driven by a range of overarching factors , including endemicity of infections associated with anemia , high prevalence of sickle cell anemia , blood loss linked to accidents , surgical and/or obstetrical emergencies and malnutrition , among others [ ] .
The NBTS-TTI screening department used the following assays : HBsAg ( SD HBs Ag ELISA 3.0 ) , HCV ( SD HCV ELISA 3.0 ) , Syphilis ( MEDIFF TPHA ) and HIV testing ELISA-1 ( Vironostika HIV-1 Plus O Microelisa System ) and ELISA - 2 ( AccuDiag™ HIV 1 & 2 Ag/Ab ELISA Generation ) or Murex HIV Ag/Ab Combination ( ABBOTT Diagnostics Division ) .

In this study , a set of immunological biomarkers was studied in order to understand protection upon vaccination with yellow fever ( 17DD-YF ) vaccine .
For this purpose , the immunological memory statuses of circulating T- and B-cells along with the plasmatic molecules ( cytokine profile ) were monitored before and at distinct time-points after primary vaccination .
The yellow fever ( YF ) vaccine is a live attenuated virus isolated in the 1930s , which has been considered the most robust and successful vaccine ever developed [ ] .
Decreased levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ produced by CD4 and CD8 T-cells and increased levels of IL-10 CD4 T-cells were found in primary 17DD-YF vaccinees over time [ ] .
Moreover , the percentage of cytokine cells were also quantified amongst CD4 and CD8 T-cells ( TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-10 and IL-5 ) as well as CD19 B-cells ( TNF-α , IL-10 and IL-5 ) .
Expansion of memory CD8 T-cells ( CCR7 , Ki-67 and Bcl-2 ) has been reported following vaccination 17D-YF vaccination as a gradual and continuous process associated with high-quality immune memory observed at early ( 3 month ) and late ( 2 years ) stages [ ] .
The increase of IL-5 produced by CD4 and CD8 T-cells has been already reported at day30 after 17DD-YF primary vaccination [ ] .
A series of outbreaks of yellow fever has triggered the need for a global response .
Recent dengue and Zika epidemics in the Asia–Pacific region indicate the potential risk of the spread of yellow fever to Asian-Pacific countries , ” she says , noting that all three viruses are transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito .
Of the 40 countries covered by the strategy , 16 have implemented preventive mass campaigns and 35 include yellow fever in their routine immunization programmes .
For Tomori , it is not only the weakness of routine yellow fever vaccination that makes Nigeria a priority for the EYE strategy .
The yellow fever and measles vaccines are usually given simultaneously later , when a child is 9 months old , but infants are not always brought back and when they are , often the vaccine has run out .
Although effective vaccines exist against other flaviviral diseases like yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , dengue vaccine development is complicated by the presence of four virus serotypes and the possibility of partial immunity enhancing dengue disease severity .
As highly effective live attenuated vaccines ( LAVs ) have been developed against other flaviviruses such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses , the prospects for a dengue vaccine should be good ( ) .
While various cell types are susceptible to ZIKV infection in interferon ( IFN ) receptor 1-deficient mice ( Ifnar1 ) , ZIKV susceptibility in the testes of wild-type immunocompetent mice has not been systematically evaluated .
To identify testicular cell types permissive for ZIKV , we infected murine testicular cells , GCs , SCs , LCs , and MCs , with ZIKV in vitro ( MR 766 , multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) = 0.1 plaque-forming unit ( PFU ) per cell ) , and stained for ZIKV envelope protein ( ZIKV-E ) and testicular cell markers , DEAD-Box helicase 4 ( DDX4 ) for GCs , SRY-box 9 ( SOX9 ) for SCs , 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ( 17β-HSD ) for LCs , and α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) for MCs .

ZIKV vRNA was detected in the semen , brain , and seminal vesicles of some vehicle-treated mice , but no BC-treated mice had detectable ZIKV vRNA ( Supplementary Fig . )
Culture medium for the GCs was StemPro-34 SFM ( Gibco , 10640 ) supplemented with StemPro supplement , 1× ( Gibco , 10641 ) ; -glucose , 6 mg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , G8769-100ML ) ; bovine serum albumin , 0.50 % ( Hyclone , G8769-100ML ) ; MEM vitamin solution ( Gibco , 11120-052 ) ; β-estradiol , 30 ng ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , E2758-1G ) ; progesterone , 60 ng ml ( Calbiochem , 5341 ) ; fetal bovine serum , 1 % ( Gibco , 10438026 ) ; antibiotic–antimycotic solution ( Gibco , 15240062 ) ; bovine holo-transferrin , 100 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , T1283-500MG ) ; insulin , 25 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , I9278-5ML ) ; human glial-derived neurotrophic factor , 20 ng ml ( Life , PHC7041 ) ; human basic fibroblast growth factor , 10 ng ml ( Life , PHG0023 ) ; non-essential amino acid solution ( Gibco , 11140-050 ) ; -glutamine , 2 mM ( Gibco , 45000-676 ) ; putrescine , 60 μM ( Sigma-Aldrich , P7505-25G ) ; sodium selenite , 30 nM ( Sigma-Aldrich , 214485-5 G ) ; pyruvic acid , 30 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , 107360-25 G ) ; d ( ) -lactic acid , 1 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , L1250-500ML ) ; β-mercaptoethanol , 50 μM ( Gibco , 21985-023 ) ; ascorbic acid , 100 mM ( Sigma-Aldrich , A4544-25G ) ; -biotin , 10 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , B4639-500MG ) ; and mouse epidermal growth factor , 20 ng ml ( Life , PHG0313 ) .
Reverse transcription was carried out with random hexamer primers or strand-specific tagged primers of ZIKV plus β-actin ( ACTB ) gene-specific primer of human or mouse using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) .
A useful tool that can help researchers answer this and other related questions is a computational simulator that implements a mathematical model describing the human immune response to vaccination against yellow fever .
The four experiments were : a ) simulation of a scenario in which an individual was vaccinated against yellow fever for the first time ; b ) simulation of a booster dose ten years after the first dose ; c ) simulation of the immune response to the yellow fever vaccine in individuals with different levels of naïve CD8+ T cells ; and d ) simulation of the immune response to distinct doses of the yellow fever vaccine .
Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were mild or moderate in both groups with the exception of a 4-year old girl in Test group with grade 3 fever which resolved without sequelae .
Symptoms include fever , abdominal pain , and nausea , which last between one to four weeks , and 1–2 % of hospitalized cases result in death , .
Improved sanitation contributed to the sharp decline of typhoid fever in industrialized countries during the early 20th century , but such infrastructure is slow to materialize in places where the disease remains endemic , .
Local reactogenicity events ( at the site of injection ) included pain , tenderness , erythema/redness , swelling/induration and pruritus after study vaccine administration .
Tenderness as a solicited reaction was not sought in children as it is difficult to assess in younger participants .
Tenderness was sought in adults and adolescents only .
Solicited systemic AEs included fever , headache , fatigue , arthralgia , myalgia , chills , nausea/vomiting and acute allergic reaction after study vaccine administration .
Tenderness was not elicited in young children but was a common immediate reaction in adolescents with 4.2 % and 16.7 % in Test and Comparator vaccine groups , respectively .
Irrespective of the age and dose , pain and tenderness were the most common solicited AEs reported in both groups .
Pain , tenderness and headache were the most common solicited AEs reported among adults in both groups .
Fever was reported by 3 participants ( 4.2 % ) in Test and 1 ( 1.4 % ) in Comparator groups .
Fever was reported by 4 participants ( 5.9 % ) in Test and 2 ( 2.9 % ) in Comparator groups .
All solicited and unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in intensity in both vaccine groups with the exception of a 4-year old girl in Test group with grade 3 fever that resolved without sequelae .
A similar correlation was observed in a previous study and SBA titers were inversely correlated with susceptibility to typhoid fever .

Those with blood-culture confirmed typhoid fever will be followed up till 90 days to estimate costs and clinical outcomes of the illness episodes .
The burden of enteric fever is predicted to worsen with the emergence of multi-drug resistant strain H58 in this region .
These recommendations have remained unimplemented in India partly due to a perceived decline in the incidence and severity of typhoid fever in recent hospital-based reports accompanied with evidence of heterogeneous distribution of disease .
Active , community-based surveillance will estimate the true incidence of typhoid fever and provide a better understanding of transmission of typhoid in the population than available data from hospital based extrapolations .
A digital thermometer and a fever diary card will be provided , and primary caregivers will be trained to use the thermometer and document the temperature three times a day .
The study team will also document the temperature of the child in the fever diary card during home visits .
At each daily contact during the fever follow up , the study team will document information pertaining to the previous calendar day including the highest documented temperature .
Any reported fever for 3 or more consecutive days will be designated as ‘ Suspected Typhoid Fever ’ and the child will be encouraged to visit the study clinic .
Any subsequent fever within the next 24 h will warrant a blood culture .
We propose a blood culture in those with three or more days of reported fever as the prevalence of antibiotic therapy in those with over 3 days of fever is substantial .

Typhoid fever ( TF ) is a serious disease and the most common etiology of bloodstream infections in febrile patients in the Indian subcontinent .
In our study of a rural Nepalese population with culture-confirmed TF , we have shown that dual therapy was superior to monotherapy in terms of time to defervescence and bacteremia elimination , both in outpatient and inpatient settings .
Typhoid ( Enteric ) Fever ( TF ) is a human-restricted disease caused by the pathogens Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi ( S. Typhi ) and Paratyphi ( S. Paratyphi ) , which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality when untreated .
In the 1990s fluoroquinolones were introduced as effective alternative agents and became the treatment of choice for TF .
However , it should be noted that in the Israeli study sample size was small , the study population consisted of travelers , who had not been exposed to TF in the past , and the infecting Salmonella strain was identical in all cases .
In light of such sparse experimental evidence , we set out to compare the efficacy of dual antibiotic regimens consisting of a third-generation cephalosporin and azithromycin to treatment with each of these agents alone for uncomplicated TF in typhoid-endemic areas , and hypothesized that combination therapy would outperform monotherapy in terms of FCT and bacteremia elimination rate .
Febrile adult patients attending the emergency room ( ER ) or outpatient department ( OPD ) , who were clinically suspected of having TF by Dhulikhel Hospital ’ s physicians and who complied with the study inclusion and exclusion criteria , were given a detailed explanation regarding the study and asked to sign written informed consent forms .
Case definition for suspected TF included undifferentiated fever lasting more than 48–72 hours prior to antibiotic treatment .
The use of paracetamol was restricted to pain relief and not fever alleviation , and FCT was determined after confirmation that the patient had not taken paracetamol 12 hours prior to vital signs measurement .
Treating TF in the Indian subcontinent has become challenging due to rising multidrug resistance .
Each of these antibiotics is also used separately to treat TF , albeit with known limitations .
Only blood culture-confirmed cases were eligible to avoid biases that could arise from the inclusion of patients presenting with symptoms similar to those of TF , and for which an alternative diagnosis was eventually found [ , ] .
The most common adverse effects include gastrointestinal ( GI ) upset , stomatitis , rash , neurological symptoms ( headache , fatigue , agitation ) , mild transaminitis , and macrocytosis [ ] .
Its potential toxicities include nephrotoxicity , hyperkalemia , pancytopenia , neutropenia , skin rash , and Steven Johnson ’ s syndrome many of which overlap with the toxicity of MTX [ ] .
A 68-year-old female with a history of rheumatoid arthritis on 10 mg MTX weekly presented to the emergency department ( ED ) with weakness , lethargy , and decreased oral intake .
The pertinent physical exam included severe oral mucositis , lip ulceration , and an erythematous rash under her left breast .
Her oral ulcers remained unresolved ; leukocyte count continued to drop reaching a nadir of 1.9 K/uL and absolute neutrophil count dipped to 0.7 K/uL over the course of next 2 days .
Leucovorin rescue was given at the dose of 10 mg/m every 6 h for a total of four doses with one dose of Filgrastim 480 mcg which resulted in the improvement of the leukocyte count , breast rash , and mouth ulcers within 24 h. The patient was discharged on day 6 of hospitalization and did well post discharge .
The most commonly reported toxicity of MTX due to its interaction with TS is pancytopenia , acute megaloblastic anemia , stomatitis , and nephrotoxicity [ ] .
We present here an overview of the current guidelines for the management of chronic cough .
In this study , the prevalence of chronic cough was higher in Oceania ( 18.1 % ) , Europe ( 12.7 % ) and America ( 11 % ) than in Asia ( 4.4 % ) and Africa ( 2.3 % ) .
The management of chronic cough can be challenging for both doctors and patients .
Moreover , only 30 % of the subjects felt that “ their doctor had dealt with their cough thoroughly ” and the medication was judged as having limited ( 57 % ) or no effectiveness ( 36 % ) .
In this study , 96 % of the subjects described an alteration of their quality of life ( QoL ) , 91 % felt depressed , 94 % reported an impact of chronic cough on their family .
Different physical complications of chronic cough have been described , including syncope , cardiac arrhythmias , incontinence or rib fracture .
A recent guideline on tools for assessing outcomes in chronic cough recommends the use of validated and reliable health-related QoL questionnaires ( Leicester Cough Questionnaire , Cough-Specific Quality-of-Life Questionnaire , Parent Cough-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire ) to assess the impact of cough .
The variability in success in treating chronic cough could be partly related to a lack of fidelity to the main elements of the diagnosis/therapeutic guidelines .
These warning signs include abnormal clinical respiratory and/or general exam , abnormal chest X-ray , smoking history of > 20 pack-years , onset or modification of cough or cough associated with voice abnormalities in a smoker over 45 years , hemoptysis , dyspnea , significant sputum production , hoarseness , fever , weight loss , GORD , failure of empirical treatment for GORD , hematemesis , dysphagia or recurrent pneumonia.
The evaluation of occupational and environmental factors in the assessment of chronic cough is recommended and a diagnosis algorithm has been recently proposed by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology ( EAACI ) , including a first step detailed clinical and occupational history .
Smoking is obviously a risk factor for chronic cough .
A recent large study performed on 14,669 subjects in Copenhagen found a prevalence of chronic cough of 3 % in never smokers , 4 % in former smokers and 8 % in current smokers .
Moreover , the results of this study suggest that the main risk factors of chronic cough could differ depending on smoking status , including i ) female sex , asthma and GORD in never smokers ; ii ) obesity , asthma and GORD in ex-smokers and iii ) airflow limitation in current smokers .
Several pollutants have been shown as being risk factors for chronic cough in general population and in asthmatic patients , depending on the level of exposure .
A very recent Japanese study found that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon , nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide was associated with an increase in cough prevalence among adults with chronic cough .
In a cross sectional survey of 200 Russian adults , exposure to heavy mining and refining industrial air pollution was also associated with chronic cough , after adjustment for smoking status , age and sex ( OR 2.16 , 95 % CI 1.07–4.35 ) .
Living close ( m ) to a major road in Beijing , China led to a higher risk of chronic cough compared to living > 200 m ( OR 2.54 , 95 % CI 1.57–4.10 ) .
Indoor pollution can also be associated with chronic cough in fragile populations .
Chronic cough is a frequent side effect of ACE inhibitor treatment .
A large analysis of almost 27,500 patients with vascular disease identified that female gender , age > 65 years and concomitant use of lipid lowering agents were clinical predictors of ACE inhibitor induced dry cough ( OR 1.92 , 95 % CI 1.68–2.18 ; OR 1.53 , 95 % CI 1.35–1.73 and OR 1.37 , 95 % CI 1.18–1.59 , respectively ) .
Indeed , viral infection of airways leads to a stimulation of the sensory C-fibers ( afferent nerves ) by inflammatory mediators and products of oxidative stress in the respiratory tract , as well as an increase in their excitability and a change in sensory nerve gene expression .
However , the exact mechanisms involved in postinfection cough are not entirely elucidated.
In a very recent meta-analysis of clinical characteristics of cough associated with B. pertussis infection , paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity ( 93.2 % and 81.8 % , respectively ) and posttussive vomiting and whooping had a high specificity ( 77.7 % and 79.5 % ) .
FeNO measurement may not be useful to predict EB in non-asthmatic subjects with chronic cough .
In patients with severe cough or refractory to ICS , oral prednisolone ( 10–30 mg/d ) for 3–5 days might be proposed .
GORD is typically characterized by symptoms such as daily heartburn and regurgitation , but can frequently be asymptomatic .
If the cough does not improve , PPI treatment should be stopped .
Different biomarkers for reflux associated cough have been studied , including pepsin and lipid-laden alveolar macrophages in broncho-alveolar lavage .
In UACS patients , cough can be caused by a variety of upper respiratory disorders , including allergic and non-allergic rhinitis and chronic rhinosinusitis.
Chronic cough was initially thought to result from PND inducing mechanical or chemical stimulation of the afferent nerves innervating the pharynx , larynx or lower airways .
However , the cough appeared to be uncommon in subjects with PND and may not be associated with PND .
Another hypothesis is a lower airway inflammation resulting from PND aspiration or mechanical stimulation from the cough itself .
The inflammatory mediators released would induce a stimulation of cough receptors previously activated by a nervous reflex induced by inflammatory stimulation of nasal mucosa .
Numerous pulmonary diseases can induce chronic cough .
Among them , COPD has been described in 11 % of the patients with chronic cough , bronchiolitis in 7.8 % , interstitial lung disease in 2.5 % , lung cancer in 2 % , bronchiectasis in 1 % –1.5 % and mycobacterial infection in 1 % –1.8 % .
Chronic cough occurs in 14 % –74 % of COPD patients , frequently associated with sputum production .
Chronic cough is also associated with an impairment of health-related QoL in COPD .
In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) , chronic dry cough is one of the predominant symptoms , associated with shortness of breath , and frequently the first occurring symptom .
Chronic cough affects 70 % –85 % of patients with IPF , has a significant impact on QoL and is a marker of disease severity and progression .
First , an upper airway inflammation related to snoring and frequent airway obstruction could lead to increased cough sensitivity associated with airway inflammation , as described above .
Second , an increased prevalence of GORD has been described in OSA-related cough and GORD has been identified as an independent predictor of cough in patients with OSA .
Clinical features of OSA-related cough include snoring , nocturnal cough , nocturnal heartburn and symptoms of rhinitis .
An important feature of OSA-related cough is the absence of excessive daytime somnolence and frequently normal Epworth sleepiness scores .
The assessment of OSA can be performed in refractory chronic cough or in case of clinical signs of OSA .
The involvement of cardiac arrythmias in chronic cough has been shown in a study assessing 120 patients with premature ventricular complexes ( PVCs ) .
In this study , 5 % of the subjects ( 6 patients ) presented PVC-related chronic cough , confirmed by multichannel recording of sleep-disordered breathing .
In these patients , cough was characterized by a sudden need to cough preceded by a tickling feeling in the throat .
The cough could not be stopped voluntarily and looked like a rapid expelling of air not preceded by inspiration .
Cough was improved in 5 patients after treatment with oral antiarrhythmic drugs .
When radiofrequency ablation procedure was performed ( 4 patients ) , it resulted in complete resolution of both arrhythmia and cough .
The prevalence of chronic cough has been specifically assessed in elderly populations .
A study performed in Korea in people aged > 65 years found a prevalence of 4.6 % of chronic cough .
Chronic cough was associated with impairment of QoL , smoking habits , asthma , allergic rhinitis , uncontrolled diabetes ( HbA1c ≥8 % ) and constipation .
Cough is a frequent symptom in athletes , associated with exposure to the sport training environment , especially in winter athletes , and predominantly following intense exercise.
The management of chronic cough in immunocompromised adults should take into account the type and severity of immune defect , geographic location and social determinants .
CHS can apply to most patients with chronic cough , different phenotypes being defined by the underlying condition .
Three main different phenotypes have been described : i ) predominant phenotype of rhinal symptoms ( such as UACS ) ; ii ) Th2-cell dominant phenotype ( cough variant asthma or NAEB ) and iii ) predominant phenotype characterized by acid reflux and heartburn ( gastroesophageal reflux cough ) .
Refractory chronic cough is considered to be a phenotype of the CHS .
Related symptoms are laryngeal paresthesia with cough , dyspnea , dysphonia , or laryngeal spasm .
In this study , the authors analyzed the patterns of cough response to inhaled irritants in different respiratory pathologies including COPD , asthma and refractory chronic cough .
Refractory chronic cough occurs more frequently in women , with an intermittent dry cough throughout the day triggered by usually non-tussive stimuli , including talking , or low dose of tussive stimuli , associated with laryngeal paresthesia and frequent dysphonia .
The diagnosis of refractory chronic cough is an exclusion diagnosis and requires the investigation of other causes as recommended by current guidelines .
A systematic examination of laryngeal structure and function may be indicated in patients with refractory chronic cough associated with laryngeal symptoms .
The treatment of unexplained and refractory chronic cough has recently been reviewed , and 4 types of treatment were identified , including non-pharmacologic therapies consisting of speech pathology-therapy based intervention ; ICSs targeting mainly eosinophilic airway inflammation ; neuromodulatory therapies acting on neural pathways ; and other therapies , including esomeprazole , macrolides and ipratropium .
Ryan et al also noted an improvement in both patients with refractory chronic cough alone and associated with paradoxical vocal fold movement .
Recent guidelines suggest a therapeutic trial of multimodality speech pathology therapy in patients with unexplained chronic cough ( Grade 2C recommendation ) .
An assessment of airway eosinophilia ( induced sputum , bronchoalveolar lavage ) or exhaled NO should be part of the assessment of refractory chronic cough .
The recent guidelines recommend ICS should not to be prescribed in adult patients with unexplained chronic cough and negative tests for bronchial hyperresponsiveness and eosinophilia ( sputum eosinophils , exhaled nitric oxide ) ( Grade 2B recommendation ) .
Centrally acting neuromodulators act on the increased neural sensitization involved in the pathophysiology of refractory chronic cough .
A pilot study performed on 16 subjects with refractory chronic cough showed an improvement of cough severity after treatment by tramadol .
Recent guidelines indicate that in adult patients with unexplained chronic cough , it is suggested to perform a therapeutic trial of gabapentin as long as the potential side effects and the risk-benefit profile are discussed with patients before use of the medication , and there is a reassessment of the risk-benefit profile at 6 months before continuing the drug ( Grade 2C recommendation ) .
An encouraging recent study tested a novel formulation of nebulized sodium chromoglicate ( PA101 ) in a randomized placebo controlled trial including 24 subjects with IPF and 28 participants with idiopathic chronic cough .
No improvement was found in subjects with idiopathic chronic cough .
GSK2339345 is an inhibitor of voltage-gated sodium channels ( VGSC ) that are involved in afferent sensory nerve fibers responsible for evoking cough .
The new concepts of peripheral and central neural hypersensitivity and neurophenotypes allowed important advances in the comprehension of physiopathological mechanisms involved in refractory chronic cough .

SW1736 and KAT-18 cells transfected with BRD4 overexpression plasmid or control vector , were treated with 2 µg/ml for 48 h , the protein expression of BRD4 , Bcl-2 and Bax was determined using western blotting ( A and B ) .
After an uneventful recovery , the patient suddenly developed cardiogenic shock on postoperative day 14 .
There was active bleeding of the epicardium from a number of pointed lesions , just opposite the tackers which had penetrated the pericardium .
Venous bleeding from the myocardium of the right ventricle , probably caused by a fundophrenicopexy suture , was stopped by resuturing , the pericardium was left open , and the left hemithorax was drained .
The patient developed cardiac tamponade on the second day due to tack-induced bleeding of an epicardial artery of the inferior surface of the heart , which required emergency pericardial drainage .
Forty-eight hours after surgery , the patient developed hypotension and sweating .
On postoperative day 5 , the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome with hypotension and oliguria .
On postoperative day 2 , the patient developed hypotension , tachycardia , and irregular pulse .
 For this c>selected patient collective , propensity score matched-pair analysis did not identify any difference in the perioperative and one-year follow-up outcome compared with TAPP , fewer intraoperative ( 0.5 vs. 1.3 % ; p = 0.009 ) but somewhat more postoperative complications ( 2.3 vs. 1.5 % ; p = 0.050 ) compared with TEP and advantages with regard to pain at rest ( 4.6 vs. 6.1 % ; p = 0.039 ) and on exertion ( 10.0 vs. 13.4 % ; p Lichtenstein technique .
If a recurrence or chronic pain is reported by the general practitioner or patient , the patient can be requested to present themselves for clinical examination .
The >c>variables used for matching were : age ( years ) , gender ( male/female ) , BMI ( kg/m ) , American Society of Anesthesiologists ASA Score ( I–IV ) , preoperative pain ( yes/no/unknown ) , defect size ( European Hernia Society [ EHS ] classification Grade I cm , Grade II = 1.5–3 cm , Grade III > 3 cm ) [ ] , defect localization ( EHS classification medial , lateral , femoral , scrotal ) [ ] , anticoagulant therapy with coumarin derivatives ( yes/no ) and antiplatelet therapy with platelet aggregation inhibitors ( yes/no ) .
EHS I ≤ 1.5 cm 43 vs. 12.8 % ) , the proportion of lateral and femoral inguinal hernias significantly larger , the proportion of scrotal inguinal hernias significantly smaller , the proportion of patients with preoperative pain significantly higher , the proportion of patients with continuing treatment with coumarin derivatives and with platelet aggregation inhibitors significantly lower and the proportion of patients with higher ASA score significantly lower .
A systematic deviation with regard to pain on exertion in favor of the Shouldice operation ( 10.0 vs. 13.4 % ; p = 0.001 ) was identified at one-year follow-up .
EHS I ≤ 1.5 cm 43.0 vs. 19.0 % ) , the proportion of medial EHS classifications significantly larger , but that of lateral and femoral significantly smaller , the proportion of patients with preoperative pain significantly larger , the proportion of patients with continuing therapy with coumarin derivatives and with platelet aggregation inhibitors significantly lower and the proportion of higher ASA scores significantly lower .
EHS I ≤ 1.5 cm 43.0 vs. 17.2 % ) , a significantly larger proportion of medial and a significantly smaller proportion of femoral and scrotal hernias by EHS classification , a significantly smaller proportion of patients with no preoperative pain , a significantly smaller proportion of patients with continuing therapy with coumarin derivatives and with platelet aggregation inhibitors and a significantly smaller proportion of patients with higher ASA score .
The variables used for matching were age , BMI , gender , ASA score , size of the hernia defect , EHS classification , preoperative pain and continuing treatment with coumarin derivatives or platelet aggregation inhibitors .
A prospective randomized trial that compared Shouldice versus TEP for primary unilateral inguinal hernia in men did not find any significant differences , apart from a longer operative time in the TEP group , between the two methods with regard to perioperative complications , hospital stay , recurrences or pain in the groin [ ] .
There was also no difference between late discomfort at a 5-year follow-up after laparoscopic TAPP and Shouldice repair [ ] .
There were no significant differences in chronic pain and complications [ ] .
In summary , the data presented here from the Herniamed Registry demonstrate that under routine conditions and on selecting patients on the basis of the influence variables age , weight , gender , defect size , defect localization , preoperative pain and certain risk factors , outcomes comparable with those of the Lichtenstein , TEP and TAPP techniques can be achieved with the Shouldice operation for primary unilateral inguinal hernia repair .
Such studies must definitely take into account the variables that impact the outcome ( age , BMI , gender , EHS defect size , EHS defect localization , ASA score , preoperative pain and continuing treatment with coumarin derivatives and with platelet aggregation inhibitors ) .

Gastritis can be caused by irritation due to excessive alcohol use , chronic vomiting , stress , or the use of certain medications such as aspirin or other anti-inflammatory drugs .
It may also be caused by any of the following : Helicobacter pylori ( H. pylori ) : A bacteria that lives in the mucous lining of the stomach ; without treatment , the infection can lead to ulcers , and in some people , stomach cancer.
However , the most common symptoms include : Nausea or recurrent upset stomach , Abdominal bloating , Abdominal pain , Vomiting , Indigestion , Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach between meals or at night , Hiccups , Loss of appetite , Vomiting blood or coffee ground-like material , Black , tarry stools , .
Treatment for gastritis usually involves : Taking antacids and other drugs ( such as proton pump inhibitors or H-2 blockers ) to reduce stomach acid , Avoiding hot and spicy foods , For gastritis caused by H. pylori infection , your doctor will prescribe a regimen of several antibiotics plus an acid blocking drug ( used for heartburn ) , If the gastritis is caused by pernicious anemia , B12 vitamin shots will be given.

The inflammation of gastritis is most often the result of infection with the same bacterium that causes most stomach ulcers .
In some cases , gastritis can lead to ulcers and an increased risk of stomach cancer .
The signs and symptoms of gastritis include : Gnawing or burning ache or pain ( indigestion ) in your upper abdomen that may become either worse or better with eating , Nausea , Vomiting , A feeling of fullness in your upper abdomen after eating , .
Most cases of indigestion are short-lived and do n't require medical care .
Stress .
Severe stress due to major surgery , injury , burns or severe infections can cause acute gastritis.
Left untreated , gastritis may lead to stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding .
Nausea and vomiting , .
Yellow fever is a viral infection transmitted by a bite from infected mosquitoes most commonly found in parts of South America and Africa .
The World Health Organization estimates there are 200,000 cases of yellow fever worldwide each year , resulting in 30,000 deaths .
Yellow fever appears to be on the rise internationally , due to a decreased immunity to infection among local populations , deforestation , climate change , and high-density urbanization .
Yellow fever is typically spread to humans from bites by infected mosquitoes .
People can not spread yellow fever among themselves through casual contact , although the infection can be transmitted directly into the blood through contaminated needles .
Mosquitoes that breed in the jungle also transmit yelllow fever to monkeys , who , in addition to humans , are a host for the disease .
For some people , yellow fever has no initial symptoms , while for others , the first symptoms appear from three to six days after exposure to the virus from a mosquito bite .
An infection with yellow fever typically has three phases .
The initial symptoms of yellow fever are : Fever and chills , Flu-like symptoms such as muscle aches , headache , and vomiting , .
Ultimately , a condition called viral hemorrhagic fever can develop , with internal bleeding ( hemorrhaging ) , high fever , and damage to the liver , kidneys , and circulatory system .
The third-phase symptoms of yellow fever can include : Jaundice ( liver damage ) , which causes yellowing of the skin and eyes , Hepatitis ( inflammation of the liver ) , Internal bleeding ( hemorrhaging ) , Vomiting blood , Shock , Multisystem organ failure leading to death , .
Yellow fever is diagnosed by your symptoms , recent travel activity , and blood tests .
Because there is no cure for the viral infection itself , medical treatment of yellow fever focuses on easing symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , and dehydration .
Because of the risk of internal bleeding , avoid aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs if you suspect you have yellow fever .
Because there is no cure for yellow fever , prevention is critical .
Call your doctor right away if you develop a fever , flu-like symptoms , or other unusual signs after taking the vaccine .
Keep in mind that vaccination has two goals : to protect the health of individual travelers coming into high-risk regions and to protect the public health of countries by preventing the import of yellow fever into their region .

Yellow fever is a viral infection spread by a particular type of mosquito .
In mild cases , yellow fever causes a fever , headache , nausea and vomiting .
But yellow fever can become more serious , causing heart , liver and kidney problems along with bleeding ( hemorrhaging ) .
There 's no specific treatment for yellow fever .
During the first three to six days after you 've contracted yellow fever — the incubation period — you wo n't experience any signs or symptoms .
Once the infection enters the acute phase , you may experience signs and symptoms including : Fever , Headache , Muscle aches , particularly in your back and knees , Sensitivity to light , Nausea , vomiting or both , Loss of appetite , Dizziness , Red eyes , face or tongue , .
Although signs and symptoms may disappear for a day or two following the acute phase , some people with acute yellow fever then enter a toxic phase .
These can include : Yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes ( jaundice ) , Abdominal pain and vomiting , sometimes of blood , Decreased urination , Bleeding from your nose , mouth and eyes , Slow heart rate ( bradycardia ) , Liver and kidney failure , Brain dysfunction , including delirium , seizures and coma , .
The toxic phase of yellow fever can be fatal .
Four weeks or more before your trip , make an appointment to see your doctor if you 're traveling to an area in which yellow fever is known to occur so that you discuss whether you need the yellow fever vaccine.
Yellow fever is caused by a virus that is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito .
Most cases of yellow fever occur in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America .
When a mosquito bites a human or a monkey infected with yellow fever , the virus enters the mosquito 's bloodstream and circulates before settling in the salivary glands .
It 's possible that local populations have been vaccinated and are protected from the disease , or that cases of yellow fever just have n't been detected and officially reported .
Complications during the toxic phase of a yellow fever infection include kidney and liver failure , jaundice , delirium , and coma .
During this time a person may experience fatigue and jaundice .
A highly effective vaccine exists to prevent yellow fever .
Yellow fever is known to be present in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America .
Side effects are usually mild , lasting five to 10 days , and may include headaches , low-grade fevers , muscle pain , fatigue and soreness at the site of injection .
More-significant reactions — such as developing a syndrome similar to actual yellow fever , inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ) or death — can occur , most often in infants and older adults .
In addition to getting the vaccine , you can help protect yourself against yellow fever by protecting yourself against mosquitoes .

Asian fetish ( also known as yellow fever ) is an interest , obsession , or preference for Asian people , culture , or things of Asian origin by those of non-Asian descent .
In the afterword to the 1988 play M. Butterfly , the writer David Henry Hwang , using the term yellow fever , a pun on the disease of the same name , discusses white men with a fetish for ( east ) Asian women .
The term yellow fever describes someone who is inflicted with a disease , meaning that someone with an Asian fetish has a sickness .
Yellow fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic disease .
Yellow fever may also refer to : The Yellow Fever , fan club for New Zealand football team Wellington Phoenix FC , Yellow Fever ( album ) , a 1975 blues-rock album by Hot Tuna , Yellow Fever !
Yellow fever : An acute systemic ( bodywide ) illness caused by a virus called a Flavivirus .
In severe cases , the viral infection causes a high fever , bleeding into the skin , and necrosis ( death ) of cells in the kidney and liver .
The damage done to the liver from the virus results in severe jaundice which yellows the skin .
Hence , the yellow in yellow fever .
Yellow fever once ravaged port cities in the United States .
Today yellow fever is most common in tropical areas of Africa and the Americas .
The virus of yellow fever is transmitted in most cases by a bite of a mosquito .
In urban settings , yellow fever may be transmitted from person to person by the Aedes aegypti mosquito .
In the jungle , yellow fever is transmitted from monkeys to people by mosquitoes that breed in tree-holes in the rainforests .
The diagnosis of yellow fever is made by observation or , if need be , by culturing the virus from a blood sample .
There is no cure for yellow fever , although antiviral medications may be tried .
Yellow fever can be prevented by vaccination .
They discovered that the fever was transmitted by the Aëdes aegypti mosquito which breeds near houses ( and also transmit dengue ) .
Sanitary engineers eradicated the mosquito and freed Cuba of yellow fever in 1902 ( the year of Reed 's death from appendicitis ) .
The vaccine against yellow fever is also based on the work of Max Theiler .
In 1929 Theiler contracted yellow fever ( not an uncommon experience among those studying the disease ) but recovered and became immune to it .
The following year Theiler discovered that yellow fever can be transmitted to white mice , which are easy to handle and are available by the thousand at small cost .
In 1951 , Max Theiler ( 1899-1972 ) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning yellow fever and how to combat it .

Yellow fever is a serious , potentially deadly flu-like disease spread by mosquitoes .
It ’ s characterized by a high fever and jaundice .
Jaundice is yellowing of the skin and eyes , which is why this disease is called yellow fever .
Yellow fever develops quickly , with symptoms occurring three to six days after exposure .
They include : headaches , muscle aches , joint aches , chills , fever , .
Common symptoms include : headaches , muscle aches , joint aches , a fever , flushing , a loss of appetite , shivers , backaches , .
Many people recover from yellow fever at this stage , but some people will develop a more serious version of this condition .
These include : decreased urination , abdominal pain , vomiting ( sometimes with blood ) , heart rhythm problems , seizures , delirium , bleeding from the nose , mouth , and eyes , .
The Flavivirus causes yellow fever , and it ’ s transmitted when an infected mosquito bites you .
Increased contact between humans and infected mosquitoes , particularly in areas where people haven ’ t been vaccinated for yellow fever , can create small-scale epidemics .
Those who haven ’ t been vaccinated for yellow fever and who live in areas populated by infected mosquitoes are at risk .
If your doctor suspects that you have yellow fever , they ’ ll order a blood test .
There ’ s no cure for yellow fever .
Vaccination is the only way to prevent yellow fever .
The vaccine for yellow fever is given as a single shot .
The Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) suggests that anyone who is 9 months through 59 years old and traveling to or living in an area where the risk of yellow fever is present should be vaccinated .
The side effects may include : a mild headache , muscle pain , fatigue , a low-grade fever , .
Often there is a gradual onset of a high fever over several days .
Weakness , abdominal pain , constipation , and headaches also commonly occur .
Diarrhea is uncommon and vomiting is not usually severe .
Some people develop a skin rash with rose colored spots .
In severe cases there may be confusion .
In the first week , the body temperature rises slowly , and fever fluctuations are seen with relative bradycardia ( Faget sign ) , malaise , headache , and cough .
A bloody nose ( epistaxis ) is seen in a quarter of cases , and abdominal pain is also possible .
In the second week , the person is often too tired to get up , with high fever in plateau around 40 °C ( 104 °F ) and bradycardia ( sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign ) , classically with a dicrotic pulse wave .
Delirium is frequent , often calm , but sometimes agitated .
This delirium gives to typhoid the nickname of nervous fever .
Diarrhea can occur in this stage : six to eight stools in a day , green , comparable to pea soup , with a characteristic smell .
However , constipation is also frequent .
In the third week of typhoid fever , a number of complications can occur : Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer 's patches ; this can be very serious , but is usually not fatal.
Encephalitis , Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis , Neuropsychiatric symptoms ( described as muttering delirium or coma vigil ) , with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects.
Metastatic abscesses , cholecystitis , endocarditis , and osteitis , The fever is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours .
One-third of affected individuals develop a macular rash on the trunk.
Platelet count goes down slowly and risk of bleeding rises.
By the end of third week , the fever starts subsiding , .
Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer 's patches ; this can be very serious , but is usually not fatal.
Encephalitis , Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis , Neuropsychiatric symptoms ( described as muttering delirium or coma vigil ) , with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects.

One-third of affected individuals develop a macular rash on the trunk.
Platelet count goes down slowly and risk of bleeding rises.
The Gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever is Salmonella Typhi , also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi .
Typhidot is a medical test consisting of a dot ELISA kit that detects IgM and IgG antibodies against the outer membrane protein ( OMP ) of the Salmonella typhi .
The test is based on the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies to a specific 50Kd OMP antigen , which is impregnated on nitrocellulose strips .
IgM shows recent infection whereas IgG signifies remote infection .
The term 'enteric fever ' is a collective term that refers to severe typhoid and paratyphoid .
According to statistics from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the chlorination of drinking water has led to dramatic decreases in the transmission of typhoid fever in the United States .
An older , killed-whole-cell vaccine is still used in countries where the newer preparations are not available , but this vaccine is no longer recommended for use because it has a higher rate of side effects ( mainly pain and inflammation at the site of the injection ) .
To help decrease rates of typhoid fever in developing nations , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) endorsed the use of a vaccination program starting in 1999 .
Although vaccination programs for typhoid have proven to be effective , they alone can not eliminate typhoid fever .
Developing nations , such as those found in parts of Asia and Africa , have the highest rates of typhoid fever .
In 430 BC , a plague , which some believe to have been typhoid fever , killed one-third of the population of Athens , including their leader Pericles .
His writings are the primary source on this outbreak , and modern academics and medical scientists consider typhoid fever the most likely cause .
In 2006 , a study detected DNA sequences similar to those of the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever in dental pulp extracted from a burial pit dated to the time of the outbreak .
A study published in 2018 suggests that the cause was typhoid fever .
During the Spanish–American War , American troops were exposed to typhoid fever in stateside training camps and overseas , largely due to inadequate sanitation systems .
The Typhoid Board determined that during the war , more soldiers died from this disease than from yellow fever or from battle wounds .
Today , the bacillus that causes typhoid fever goes by the scientific name Salmonella enterica enterica , serovar Typhi .
In 1908 , the chlorination of public drinking water was a significant step in the US in the control of typhoid fever .
Today , the incidence of typhoid fever in developed countries is around five cases per million people per year .
The incidence of typhoid fever in the United States has markedly decreased since the early 1900s , when tens of thousands of cases were reported in the U.S. Today , less than 400 cases are reported annually in the United States , mostly in people who have recently traveled to Mexico and South America .
People develop symptoms , including fever , at this point .
Symptoms include : Poor appetite , Headaches , Generalized aches and pains , Fever as high as 104 degrees Farenheit , Lethargy , Diarrhea , .
Chest congestion develops in many people , and abdominal pain and discomfort are common .
The fever becomes constant .
Death occurred from overwhelming infection , pneumonia , intestinal bleeding , or intestinal perforation .
Several antibiotics are effective for the treatment of typhoid fever .
Symptoms include a high fever and gastrointestinal problems.
The two major symptoms of typhoid are fever and rash .
The rash , which does not affect every patient , consists of rose-colored spots , particularly on the neck and abdomen .
Other symptoms can include : weakness , abdominal pain , constipation , headaches , .
Rarely , symptoms might include confusion , diarrhea , and vomiting , but this is not normally severe .
Before traveling to a high-risk area , getting vaccinated against typhoid fever is recommended .
One in 100 people will experience a fever .
After the oral vaccine , there may be gastrointestinal problems , nausea , and headache .
The prevention of typhoid fever depends mainly on proper sewage treatment , filtration and chlorination of water , and exclusion of carriers from employment in food industries and restaurants .
Preliminary trials in the Indian army produced excellent results , and typhoid vaccination was adopted for the use of British troops serving in the South African… After an average 10–14-day incubation period , the early symptoms of typhoid appear : headache , malaise , generalized aching , fever , and restlessness that may interfere with sleep .
There may be loss of appetite , nosebleeds , cough , and diarrhea or constipation .
At that point , some patients develop a rash of small rose-coloured spots on the trunk , which lasts four or five days and then fades away .
The lymph follicles ( Peyer patches ) along the intestinal wall in which the typhoid bacilli have multiplied become inflamed and necrotic and may slough off , leaving ulcers in the walls of the intestine .
With a continued high fever , the symptoms usually increase in intensity , and mental confusion and delirium may appear .
In favourable cases , about the beginning of the fourth week , the fever begins to decline , the symptoms begin to abate , and the temperature gradually returns to normal .
If untreated , typhoid fever proves fatal in about 10 to 30 percent of all cases ; with treatment , as few as 1 percent of patients die from the disease .
Diagnosis of typhoid fever is made by blood culture , stool culture , and serological testing .
Patients who are recovering from typhoid fever are transient carriers of the disease , excreting the causative bacteria in the stool or urine for up to three months .
In paratyphoid fever , .
Signs and symptoms usually include high fever , headache , abdominal pain , and either constipation or diarrhea .
Most people with typhoid fever feel better within a few days of starting antibiotic treatment , although a small number of them may die of complications .

The most serious complications of typhoid fever — intestinal bleeding or holes ( perforations ) in the intestine — may develop in the third week of illness .
A perforated intestine occurs when your small intestine or large bowel develops a hole , causing intestinal contents to leak into your abdominal cavity and triggering signs and symptoms , such as severe abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting and bloodstream infection ( sepsis ) .
Other possible complications include : Inflammation of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ) , Inflammation of the lining of the heart and valves ( endocarditis ) , Pneumonia , Inflammation of the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) , Kidney or bladder infections , Infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ) , Psychiatric problems , such as delirium , hallucinations and paranoid psychosis , .
For that reason , some experts believe that vaccinating high-risk populations is the best way to control typhoid fever .
A vaccine is recommended if you 're traveling to areas where the risk of getting typhoid fever is high .
If you 're recovering from typhoid fever , these measures can help keep others safe : Take your antibiotics .

People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus , which can be discolored .
Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection , acute bronchitis is very common .
Acute bronchitis , also called a chest cold , usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects , although the cough may linger for weeks .
For either acute bronchitis or chronic bronchitis , signs and symptoms may include : Cough , Production of mucus ( sputum ) , which can be clear , white , yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely , it may be streaked with blood , Fatigue , Shortness of breath , Slight fever and chills , Chest discomfort , .

Protracted bacterial bronchitis is defined as a chronic productive cough with a positive bronchoalveolar lavage that resolves with antibiotics .
Symptoms of chronic bronchitis may include wheezing and shortness of breath , especially upon exertion and low oxygen saturations .
The cough is often worse soon after awakening , and the sputum produced may have a yellow or green color and may be streaked with specks of blood .
Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm ( reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle ) with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists ( e.g.
Oxygen supplementation can cause decreased respiratory drive , resulting in increased blood levels of carbon dioxide ( hypercapnia ) and subsequent respiratory acidosis .
Obesity has also been linked to an increased risk for chronic bronchitis .
Other symptoms may include : Sputum production , Sore throat , Nasal congestion , Headache , Muscle aches , Fatigue , Shortness of breath , .
Children with acute bronchitis may have symptoms of : A runny nose , Mild fever , Cough up sputum or vomit mucus , .
