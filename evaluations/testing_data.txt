Bacteria , consuming too much alcohol , certain medications , chronic stress , or other immune system problems can lead to inflammation .
And it can increase your risk of vitamin deficiencies , anemia , and cancer.
But people who do have symptoms often experience : upper abdominal pain , indigestion , bloating , nausea , vomiting , belching , loss of appetite , weight loss , .
The following can irritate the lining of your stomach and lead to chronic gastritis : long-term use of certain medications , such as aspirin and ibuprofen , excessive alcohol consumption , the presence of H. pylori bacteria , certain illnesses , such as diabetes or kidney failure , a weakened immune system , persistent , intense stress that also affects the immune system , bile flowing into the stomach , or bile reflux , .
Get medical help right away if any of the following occur : vomiting blood , rapid heartbeat , difficulty breathing or swallowing , extreme drowsiness , passing out suddenly , confusion , .
Chronic gastritis puts you at risk for bleeding in your stomach and small intestine .
It can cause severe and nagging pain .
However , the pain is temporary and usually lasts for short bursts at a time .
Acute gastritis comes on suddenly , and can be caused by injury , bacteria , viruses , stress , or ingesting irritants such as alcohol , NSAIDs , steroids , or spicy food .
Chronic gastritis might cause more of a consistent dull ache than the more intense pain of acute gastritis .
Gastritis only directly affects the stomach and may include nausea or vomiting , while gastroenteritis affects both the stomach and the intestines .
Gastroenteritis symptoms may include diarrhea in addition to nausea or vomiting .
It ’ s often the cause of peptic ulcers .
When a person can not absorb enough B-12 , they may develop pernicious anemia .
Pernicious anemia is a complication that makes it difficult for a person to create red blood cells .
Left untreated , it will get worse over time and can lead to stomach ulcers .
However , most people with chronic gastritis experience a variety of symptoms , including : indigestion , a burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach , the sensation of being full after eating a small amount , nausea and vomiting , belching , unintentional weight loss , bloating , loss of appetite , upper abdominal pain or discomfort , bleeding , usually only in erosive gastritis , Gastritis is termed erosive if the stomach lining has been worn away , exposing the tissue to stomach acids.
Causes of this include : overuse or long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) , such as ibuprofen and naproxen , excessive alcohol consumption , chronic stress , injuries and impact , exposure to radiation , recurring bile reflux from the small intestine , cocaine use , .
Possible risk factors for chronic gastritis include : diets high in salt or preservatives , diets high in fat and oil , especially saturated and trans fats , smoking , long-term consumption of alcohol , conditions that weaken the immune system , cocaine use , long-term use of NSAIDs and some other medications , long-term use of medications for acid reflux and indigestion , .
Erosive gastritis can cause peptic ulcers .
Severe ulcers may eventually cause internal bleeding , which can be life-threatening if left untreated .
During treatment people may develop fever , headache , and muscle pains , a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer .
In the classic form , it evolves from a macule to a papule and finally to an erosion or ulcer .
There may be a symmetrical , reddish-pink , non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities , including the palms and soles .
Within a few weeks of the original chancre healing , you may experience a rash that begins on your trunk but eventually covers your entire body — even the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet .
This rash is usually not itchy and may be accompanied by wart-like sores in the mouth or genital area .
Some people also experience hair loss , muscle aches , a fever , sore throat and swollen lymph nodes .
Later symptoms may include deafness , teeth deformities and saddle nose — where the bridge of the nose collapses .
Syphilis can cause a number of problems with your nervous system , including : Stroke , Meningitis , Hearing loss , Visual problems , Dementia , Loss of pain and temperature sensations , Sexual dysfunction in men ( impotence ) , Bladder incontinence , Sudden , lightning-like pains , .
Adults with sexually transmitted syphilis or other genital ulcers have an estimated two- to fivefold increased risk of contracting HIV .
Vagina , Symptom Checker , Muscle pain , .
Syphilis was once a major public health threat , commonly causing serious long-term health problems such as arthritis , brain damage , and blindness .
They may also experience moist warts in the groin , white patches on the inside of the mouth , swollen lymph glands , fever , and weight loss .
If the infection is n't treated , it may then progress to a stage characterized by severe problems with the heart , brain , and nerves that can result in paralysis , blindness , dementia , deafness , impotence , and even death if it 's not treated .
If syphilis is left untreated , it can cause serious and permanent problems such as dementia , blindness , or death .
Secondary syphilis symptoms include : a non-itchy rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the entire body , including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet .
It may be rough , red , or reddish-brown in color , oral , anal , and genital wart-like sores , muscle aches , fever , sore throat , swollen lymph nodes , patchy hair loss , headaches , weight loss , fatigue , .
Symptoms include : dementia or altered mental status , abnormal gait , numbness in the extremities , problems with concentration , confusion , headache or seizures , vision problems or vision loss , weakness , .
Adverse outcomes include early fetal death , preterm or low birth weight , neonatal deaths , and infection in infants .
Symptoms in newborns include : saddle nose , in which the bridge of the nose is missing , fever , difficulty gaining weight , a rash of the genitals , anus , and mouth , small blisters on the hands and feet that change to a copper-colored rash and spread to the face , which can be bumpy or flat , watery nasal fluid , .
Older infants and young children may experience : Hutchinson teeth , or abnormal , peg-shaped teeth , bone pain , vision loss , hearing loss , joint swelling , saber shins , a bone problem in the lower legs , scarring of the skin around the genitals , anus , and mouth , gray patches around the outer vagina and anus , .
Cerebrospinal fluid : This may be collected through a spinal tap and examined to test for any impact on the nervous system.
Chills , fever , nausea , achy pain , and a headache may occur on the first day of treatment .
Secondary syphilis is characterized by a skin rash that typically does not itch and may easily be mistaken for rashes caused by other illnesses .
The rash of secondary syphilis is often found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet , which is unusual for most rashes .
In some people , the rash may be mild and not noticed .
Fever , enlarged lymph nodes , fatigue , weight loss , hair loss , headaches , and muscle aches have all been reported in the secondary stage of syphilis .
Symptoms that can result from the late stage of syphilis include problems with movement , gradual loss of sight , dementia , paralysis , and numbness .
If infected babies are born and survive , they are at risk for serious problems including seizures and developmental delays .
Some of the better known complications of late syphilis include blindness , dementia , aortic aneurysm , deafness , stroke , and other complications related to spread of the infection to the brain .

Skin rashes and a sore throat may develop during the second stage of syphilis .
The rash won ’ t itch and is usually found on the palms and soles , but it may occur anywhere on the body .
Some people don ’ t notice the rash before it goes away .
Other symptoms of secondary syphilis may include : headaches , swollen lymph nodes , fatigue , fever , weight loss , hair loss , aching joints , .
Some other potential outcomes of tertiary syphilis include : blindness , deafness , mental illness , memory loss , destruction of soft tissue and bone , neurological disorders , such as stroke or meningitis , heart disease , neurosyphilis , which is an infection of the brain or spinal cord , .
If your doctor suspects that you ’ re having nervous system problems because of tertiary syphilis , you may need a lumbar puncture , or spinal tap .
The bacteria can be killed , but treatment will most likely focus on easing pain and discomfort .
Babies born with congenital syphilis can also have the following : deformities , developmental delays , seizures , rashes , fever , swollen liver or spleen , anemia , jaundice , infectious sores , .
The disease can be transmitted from any contact with one of the ulcers , which are teeming with spirochetes .
This phase can include hair loss ; a sore throat ; white patches in the nose , mouth , and vagina ; fever ; headaches ; and a skin rash .
These wart-like lesions , as well as the skin rash , are highly contagious .
The rash can occur on the palms of the hands , and the infection can be transmitted by casual contact.
The ABCs of Skin Cancer , Aging and Addiction , Penis Curved When Erect , Allergy Relief for Your Family , .
Other generalized symptoms include fever , sore throat , enlargement of the lymph nodes , and headaches .
Another neurologic disorder , tabes dorsalis , or locomotor ataxia , is produced by degeneration of the posterior columns of the spinal cord ; it brings on intense back pain , lack of muscular coordination , and wasting .
If congenital syphilis is not treated , blindness , deafness , perforation of the palate , inflammation of the liver , and involvement of the central nervous system may ensue .
However , in curing late-stage syphilis , nothing can repair the neurologic or other damage already caused by the spirochetes .
In its early stages , the great pox produced a rash similar to smallpox ( also known as variola ) .
The ulcers suffered by British soldiers in Portugal were termed The Black Lion .
Unpleasant side effects of mercury treatment included gum ulcers and loose teeth .
If it 's suspected that you have nervous system complications of syphilis , your doctor may also suggest collecting a sample of cerebrospinal fluid through a procedure called a lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) .
Signs and symptoms include a fever , chills , nausea , achy pain and headache .

Yellow fever is a viral disease of typically short duration .
In most cases , symptoms include fever , chills , loss of appetite , nausea , muscle pains particularly in the back , and headaches .
In about 15 % of people within a day of improving , the fever comes back , abdominal pain occurs , and liver damage begins causing yellow skin .
In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon , early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population are important to prevent outbreaks .
In 2013 , yellow fever resulted in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths , with nearly 90 % of these occurring in African nations .
Since the 1980s , the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing .
In the 18th and 19th centuries , yellow fever was seen as one of the most dangerous infectious diseases .
Yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days .
Most cases only cause a mild infection with fever , headache , chills , back pain , fatigue , loss of appetite , muscle pain , nausea , and vomiting .
In 15 % of cases , however , people enter a second , toxic phase of the disease with recurring fever , this time accompanied by jaundice due to liver damage , as well as abdominal pain .
Bleeding in the mouth , the eyes , and the gastrointestinal tract cause vomit containing blood , hence the Spanish name for yellow fever , vómito negro ( black vomit ) .
There may also be kidney failure , hiccups , and delirium .
Yellow fever is caused by the yellow fever virus , a 40– to 50-nm-wide enveloped RNA virus , the type species and namesake of the family Flaviviridae .
After entering the host cell , the viral genome is replicated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and in the so-called vesicle packets .
The urban cycle is responsible for the major outbreaks of yellow fever that occur in Africa .
Because of this sylvatic cycle , yellow fever can not be eradicated .
Concern exists about yellow fever spreading to southeast Asia , where its vector A. aegypti already occurs .
Fatality may occur when cytokine storm , shock , and multiple organ failure follow .
Yellow fever is most frequently a clinical diagnosis , made on the basis of symptoms and the infected person 's whereabouts prior to becoming ill .
Since mild courses of yellow fever can also contribute significantly to regional outbreaks , every suspected case of yellow fever ( involving symptoms of fever , pain , nausea , and vomiting 6-10 days after leaving the affected area ) is treated seriously .
If yellow fever is suspected , the virus can not be confirmed until 6-10 days after the illness .
Serologically , an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay during the acute phase of the disease using specific IgM against yellow fever or an increase in specific IgG titer ( compared to an earlier sample ) can confirm yellow fever .
Together with clinical symptoms , the detection of IgM or a four-fold increase in IgG titer is considered sufficient indication for yellow fever .
In a differential diagnosis , infections with yellow fever must be distinguished from other feverish illnesses such as malaria .
Institutional measures for prevention of yellow fever include vaccination programmes and measures of controlling mosquitoes .
Programmes for distribution of mosquito nets for use in homes are providing reductions in cases of both malaria and yellow fever .
Adult mosquitos can be killed through insecticide spray usage , which decreases the transmission of yellow fever .
In rare cases ( less than one in 200,000 to 300,000 ) , the vaccination can cause yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease , which is fatal in 60 % of cases .
Another possible side effect is an infection of the nervous system , which occurs in one in 200,000 to 300,000 cases , causing yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease , which can lead to meningoencephalitis and is fatal in less than 5 % of cases .
According to the WHO , mass vaccination can not eliminate yellow fever because of the vast number of infected mosquitoes in urban areas of the target countries , but it will significantly reduce the number of people infected .
Similar efforts may be effective against yellow fever .
As for other flavivirus infections , no cure is known for yellow fever .
Acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin ) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect , which can be devastating in the case of internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever .
Yellow fever is common in tropical and subtropical areas of South America and Africa .
The historical record shows an outbreak of yellow fever occurred in Recife , Brazil , between 1685 and 1690 .
It began as an outbreak in brown howler monkeys , which serve as a sentinel species for yellow fever , that then spread to men working in the jungle .
By the end of May the outbreak appeared to be declining after more than 3,000 suspected cases , 758 confirmed and 264 deaths confirmed to be yellow fever .
Though the main vector ( A. aegypti ) also occurs in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia , the Pacific , and Australia , yellow fever has never occurred in these parts of the globe until the introduction of 11 cases by jet travel from an outbreak in Africa in 2016 .
The evolutionary origins of yellow fever most likely lie in Africa , with transmission of the disease from nonhuman primates to humans .
When an outbreak of yellow fever would occur in an African village where colonists resided , most Europeans died , while the native population usually suffered nonlethal symptoms resembling influenza .
The first definitive outbreak of yellow fever in the New World was in 1647 on the island of Barbados .
The first mention of the disease by the name yellow fever occurred in 1744 .
McNeill argues that the environmental and ecological disruption caused by the introduction of sugar plantations created the conditions for mosquito and viral reproduction , and subsequent outbreaks of yellow fever .
In Colonial times and during the Napoleonic Wars , the West Indies were known as a particularly dangerous posting for soldiers due to yellow fever being endemic in the area .
The mortality rate in British garrisons in Jamaica was seven times that of garrisons in Canada , mostly because of yellow fever and other tropical diseases such as malaria .
The historian J. R. McNeill asserts that yellow fever accounted for about 35,000 to 45,000 casualties of these forces during the fighting .
In 1853 , Cloutierville , Louisiana , had a late-summer outbreak of yellow fever that quickly killed 68 of the 91 inhabitants .
650 residents of Savannah , Georgia died from yellow fever in 1854 .
In 1873 , Shreveport , Louisiana , lost almost a quarter of its population to yellow fever .
The result was a huge epidemic of yellow fever .
The steamship John D. Porter took people fleeing Memphis northward in hopes of escaping the disease , but passengers were not allowed to disembark due to concerns of spreading yellow fever .
Mars had an uncommonly dense atmosphere , but its inhabitants were probably protected from the fever by their newly discovered canals , which were perhaps made to absorb carbon and prevent the disease .
In 1848 , Josiah C. Nott suggested that yellow fever was spread by insects such as moths or mosquitoes , basing his ideas on the pattern of transmission of the disease .
Carlos Finlay , a Cuban doctor and scientist , proposed in 1881 that yellow fever might be transmitted by mosquitoes rather than direct human contact .
Since the losses from yellow fever in the Spanish–American War in the 1890s were extremely high , Army doctors began research experiments with a team led by Walter Reed , and composed of doctors James Carroll , Aristides Agramonte , and Jesse William Lazear .
Yellow fever was the first virus shown to be transmitted by mosquitoes .
He also campaigned against yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal .
A previous effort of canal building by the French had failed ( in part due to mortality from the high incidence of yellow fever and malaria , which killed many workers ) .
Although Dr. Walter Reed has received much of the credit in United States history books for beating yellow fever , he had fully credited Dr. Finlay with the discovery of the yellow fever vector , and how it might be controlled .
Reed 's research was essential in the fight against yellow fever .
Like Cuba and Panama , Brazil also led a highly successful sanitation campaign against mosquitoes and yellow fever .
The eradication of yellow fever strengthened the relationship between the US and Mexico , which had not been very good in the past .
The eradication of yellow fever was also a major step toward better global health .
Using vector control and strict vaccination programs , the urban cycle of yellow fever was nearly eradicated from South America .
With few countries establishing regular vaccination programs , measures to fight yellow fever have been neglected , making the future spread of the virus more likely .
In the hamster model of yellow fever , early administration of the antiviral ribavirin is an effective early treatment of many pathological features of the disease .
Yellow fever has been researched by several countries as a potential biological weapon .
The term yellow fever appears on p. 186 .

The symptoms of yellow fever include fever , headache , and muscle aches , with some patients going on to develop life-threatening complications.
Yellow fever is an acute viral infectious disease transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes .
Though many cases of yellow fever are mild and self-limiting , yellow fever can also be a life-threatening disease causing hemorrhagic fever and hepatitis ( hence the term yellow from the jaundice it can cause ) .
An increase in the number of cases of yellow fever in the last few decades has led to campaigns aimed at improving public awareness and disease prevention for this re-emerging infectious disease .
During the late 18th century , a severe yellow fever outbreak struck New England and several North American port cities .
In the late 19th century , Dr. Carlos Finlay , a Cuban physician , first proposed the theory that a mosquito transmits yellow fever .
It was not until 1900 , using earlier research from Dr. Finlay as a foundation , that U.S. Army Major Dr. Walter Reed and his team proved that mosquitoes , in fact , transmit yellow fever .
This groundbreaking idea was instrumental in leading to the subsequent control of yellow fever in various regions .
This successful vaccine helped control and eliminate yellow fever from various countries in Africa and South America during the mid-20th century .
Unfortunately , yellow fever has had a large outbreak of the disease that began in 2017 and has spread to several Brazilian states .
A virus causes yellow fever .
Tissue damage to the liver , for example , can lead to jaundice and disrupt the body 's blood-clotting mechanism , leading to the hemorrhagic complications sometimes seen with yellow fever .
The bite of infected mosquitoes transmits yellow fever to humans .
There are three transmission cycles for yellow fever .
Yellow fever is endemic in tropical and subtropical regions of both Africa and South America , though an estimated 90 % of the worldwide reported infections occur in Africa .
The bite of infected mosquitoes ( for example , Haemagogus leucocelaenus and/or Aedes serratus mosquitoes ) transmits yellow fever to humans .
Direct contact with other infected individuals does not transmit yellow fever .
Humans with yellow fever are infectious and can transmit the virus to uninfected mosquitoes shortly before the onset of fever and for three to five days after the onset of symptoms .
A variety of specialists may become involved in the care of patients who develop symptoms of yellow fever .
Initially , primary care physicians , including family physicians , internists , emergency physicians , and pediatricians , may encounter patients with yellow fever .
Infectious-disease specialists care for individuals diagnosed with yellow fever , as well .
Patients with yellow fever may see other specialists depending on the severity of their illness and the development of complications ( for example , a nephrologist in cases of kidney failure ) .
After infection with the yellow fever virus , many individuals will experience no clinically apparent manifestations of the mosquito-borne disease ( asymptomatic ) , while others will go on to develop a mild , self-limiting flu-like illness characterized by the following symptoms and signs : Fever , Chills , Generalized muscle pain , Back pain , Headache , Malaise , Weakness , HIV , Nausea , Vomiting , .
In addition to the above symptoms , the following symptoms and signs may also develop : Abdominal pain , Prevention , Bleeding from the gums , nose , eyes , and/or stomach , Blood in the stool and blood in the vomit , Easy bruising of the skin , Kidney failure , Confusion , Seizures , Coma , .
Bacterial Infections 101 Pictures Slideshow Take the Tummy Trouble Quiz Hepatitis C Slideshow Pictures Because the symptoms during the initial phase of yellow fever are nonspecific and similar to a flu-like illness , diagnosis during this stage can be difficult .
Various blood test abnormalities may be present in individuals with yellow fever , particularly those who go on to develop the second toxic phase of the disease .
None of these test results is specific to yellow fever and alone allow the health care provider to make a diagnosis .
The laboratory diagnosis of yellow fever requires specialized testing .
Blood tests may demonstrate the presence of virus-specific antibodies ( IgM and IgG ) produced by the immune system in response to the infection , though cross-reactivity with antibodies from other flaviviruses may occur .
There is no specific curative treatment for yellow fever .
Treatment is supportive and aimed at relieving the symptoms of the disease , including the pain and fever .
As previously mentioned , the majority of patients who do develop symptoms from yellow fever will experience a mild course of illness that will resolve on its own .
Supportive measures implemented depend on the severity of the disease , and may include oxygen administration , , intravenous fluid administration for dehydration , , medications to increase blood pressure in cases of circulatory collapse , , transfusion of blood products in cases of severe bleeding , , antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections , , dialysis for kidney failure , and , endotracheal intubation ( placement of a breathing tube ) and mechanical ventilation in cases of respiratory failure.
Bacterial Infections 101 Pictures Slideshow Take the Tummy Trouble Quiz Hepatitis C Slideshow Pictures For individuals with yellow fever who develop the acute mild course of the illness , the symptoms will generally last about three to four days , and most patients will recover fully .
The prognosis for individuals who develop uncomplicated yellow fever is generally excellent .
However , for those patients who go on to develop the toxic phase of yellow fever , case-fatality rates range from 20 % -50 % depending on the underlying condition of the patient and the availability of supportive resources .
In those individuals who survive yellow fever , generally there is no residual permanent organ damage .
Vaccination remains the most effective way of preventing yellow fever .
It provides immunity ( boosts the immune system ) against yellow fever in 95 % of individuals within one week of its administration .
Health care providers recommended vaccination for travelers going to areas where yellow fever is endemic ( at least 10 days before going to the area ) and to vaccinate local populations who are at risk .
Effective mosquito-control measures are also an important component for preventing or minimizing the risk of yellow fever .
Health care providers need to consider the individual 's underlying health , their risk of exposure to yellow fever , and the contraindications to vaccine administration before recommending it .
Individuals who do experience side effects from the yellow fever vaccine will generally experience mild symptoms , including low-grade fever , muscle aches , and headache .

The Flavivirus causes yellow fever .
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate that in 2013 , there were between 84,000 severe cases of yellow fever and between 29,000 and 60,000 fatalities .
Here are some key points about cold yellow fever .
Mosquitoes spread yellow fever .
If a mosquito bites a monkey that has the fever , they can pass it to humans .
Yellow fever can occur in settlements close to the jungle , where infected monkeys and mosquitoes live , and it can spread from there .
Most people with yellow fever do not develop symptoms , or the symptoms are very mild .
Yellow fever has an incubation period of between 3 and 6 days , so it takes from 3 to 6 days for signs and symptoms to appear after a person is infected .
The main symptoms of yellow fever are a high temperature , a slow pulse , albuminuria , jaundice , congestion of the face , and hemorrhage , or bleeding .
Signs and symptoms are categorized into two stages : In the early , acute stage , the individual may experience : aching muscles , particularly the back and knees , a high fever , dizziness , a headache , loss of appetite , nausea , shivers , or chills , vomiting , .
These include : recurring fever , abdominal pain , vomiting , sometimes with blood , tiredness , sluggishness , lethargy , jaundice , which gives the skin and whites of the eyes a yellow tinge , kidney failure , liver failure , hemorrhage , delirium , seizures , and sometimes coma , arrhythmias , or irregular heartbeats , bleeding from the nose , mouth , and eyes , .
Within 7 to 10 days , yellow fever is fatal in around half of all people who enter the toxic phase .
A flavivirus causes yellow fever .
There is no effective antiviral medication to treat yellow fever , so treatment consists of supportive care in a hospital .
In 2014 , a study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases reported that changes in white blood cells could signal an early sign of fatal yellow fever .
In the past , yellow fever devastated communities , including those in the United States ( U.S. ) and Europe .
In the middle of the 20th century , scientists developed a safe and effective vaccine that prevents yellow fever .
Side effects may include : headaches , low-grade fevers , muscle pain , tiredness , soreness at the injection site , in very rare cases , infants and older people may develop more serious reactions , such as encephalitis , .
Most people do not develop symptoms , but those who do may experience weakness and tiredness for several months .
What 's to know about yellow fever ?
Yellow fever , acute infectious disease , one of the great epidemic diseases of the tropical world , though it sometimes has occurred in temperate zones as well .
Yellow fever appears with a sudden onset of fever , chills , headache , backache , nausea , and vomiting .
The skin and eyes may appear yellow—a condition known as jaundice and a sign that gives rise to the disease ’ s popular name .
There is no specific treatment for those with yellow fever beyond good nursing and supportive care .
However , yellow fever is an outstanding example of a completely preventable disease .
Western Africa has long been regarded as the home of yellow fever , although the first recorded outbreaks of the disease were in central and coastal South America after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century .
For the next 300 years , yellow fever , given various names such as Yellow Jack and “ the saffron scourge , ” was one of the great plagues of the New World .
By the late 19th century there were several theories about the cause and transmission of yellow fever .
Treatment consisted of “ vigorous measures ” to purge the infection : doses of ipecacuanha to induce vomiting , castor oil to loosen the bowels , and enemas of cold water with turpentine to expel gas .
In 1881 Cuban epidemiologist Carlos Juan Finlay suggested that yellow fever was caused by an infectious agent transmitted by a mosquito now known as Aedes aegypti .
In his investigation of Finlay ’ s theory , U.S. Army pathologist and bacteriologist Major Walter Reed demonstrated in 1900 the transmission of yellow fever from one human to another through the bite of A. aegypti .
The last outbreak of yellow fever in the United States occurred in 1905 , when New Orleans , Louisiana , and other ports of the South were invaded .
In 1927 researchers from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research , working in West Africa and the United States , demonstrated that yellow fever was transmitted by a specific virus , and over the next decade a vaccine was developed from attenuated strains of the virus ( an achievement for which Rockefeller researcher Max Theiler eventually won a Nobel Prize ) .
Since then , ravaging epidemics have not broken out as in the past ; nevertheless , the World Health Organization estimates that some 30,000 people die each year in areas where yellow fever is endemic .
The course of yellow fever is rapid .
The onset of symptoms is then abrupt , with headache , backache , rapidly rising fever , nausea , and vomiting .
This acute stage lasts two or three days , after which the patient either begins to recover or proceeds to a deeper toxic state marked by high fever , slow pulse rate , and the vomiting of dark blood .
Because the virus destroys liver cells , jaundice ( yellowing of the skin and eyes by deposition of bile pigment ) is a common sign in persons with yellow fever .
In the early stages of yellow fever , its symptoms are similar to those of other tropical fevers such as malaria , leptospirosis , or dengue .
Treatment is supportive and is designed to correct the acid–base imbalance and electrolyte abnormalities caused by vomiting , heart failure , and kidney derangements .
Good nursing and supportive care , particularly in reducing fever , are important both in maintaining comfort and in reducing mortality .
Still , control of mosquito populations is an essential component of any program designed to prevent the spread of yellow fever , particularly in urban areas .
In these regions , human cases will continue as long as there remain unimmunized persons , for there is no known practical way of eliminating the virus of yellow fever from the animal and mosquito populations of the vast tropical forests in South America and Africa .

Untreated babies may become developmentally delayed , have seizures , or die .
The rash may become maculopapular or pustular .
Other symptoms may include fever , sore throat , malaise , weight loss , hair loss , and headache .
Common symptoms that develop over the first couple of years of life include enlargement of the liver and spleen ( 70 % ) , rash ( 70 % ) , fever ( 40 % ) , neurosyphilis ( 20 % ) , and lung inflammation ( 20 % ) .
It frequently starts within one hour and lasts for 24 hours , with symptoms of fever , muscle pains , headache , and a fast heart rate .
Other possible complications of chronic gastritis include : anemia caused by iron deficiency , anemia caused by internal bleeding , vitamin B-12 deficiency , abnormal stomach growths , such as polyps and tumors , .
Signs of internal bleeding can include : dizziness , unexplained weakness , paleness , black , tarry stools , red , fresh-looking blood in the stool , red blood in vomit or vomiting blood , unexplained drowsiness , difficulty breathing or swallowing , confusion , passing out , .
Antacids can sometimes cause constipation or diarrhea and other side effects.
Common lifestyle changes recommended for people with chronic gastritis include : quitting smoking , avoiding or reducing the use of NSAIDs , sometimes by talking to a doctor about other medications , practicing good food and personal hygiene , including washing the hands frequently , exercising regularly , drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated , managing stress and pain with relaxation techniques and practices , such as meditation , yoga , controlled breathing , and acupuncture , .
Chronic gastritis can cause pain and discomfort and lead to serious complications if left untreated .
Management of chronic gastritis involves treating any underlying conditions , taking medications to counteract stomach acid , and making lifestyle and dietary changes .
When a bacterial infection is the cause of atrophic gastritis , a person may notice symptoms that include : unusual or unintended weight loss , vomiting , lack of appetite , nausea , iron deficiency anemia , pain in the stomach , ulcers , .
When autoimmune atrophic gastritis is the cause , a person may notice symptoms of a vitamin B-12 deficiency and pernicious anemia .
Symptoms include : pain in the chest , general fatigue , tinnitus or ringing in the ears , dizziness , lightheadedness , heart palpitations , .
If this occurs , a person may notice : confusion , unsteadiness when walking , tingling or numbness in the arms or legs , .
The physical exam usually involves the doctor feeling around the stomach region to check for tenderness .
Often , the doctor will also order blood tests to look for : lowered levels of B-12 , low levels of pepsinogen , a protein that stomach cells produce , antibodies that are attacking intrinsic factor or stomach cells , higher levels of the hormone that produces stomach acid called gastrin , .
While it ’ s unclear how H. pylori spreads , it can result in stomach inflammation , loss of appetite , nausea , bloating , and abdominal pain .
Common symptoms include : loss of appetite , indigestion , black stools , nausea , vomiting , bloody vomit that looks like used coffee grounds , pain in the upper part of the abdomen , a full feeling in the upper abdomen after eating , .
There are some conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of acute gastritis , including : peptic ulcers , which may accompany gastritis , Crohn ’ s disease , which is a chronic inflammatory condition and can involve the entire digestive tract , gallstones or gallbladder disease , food poisoning , which can cause severe abdominal pain , vomiting , and diarrhea , .
Lean meats like chicken or turkey breast can be added to the diet if tolerated , though chicken broth or other soups might be best if vomiting keeps happening .
Often , your doctor will recommend a combination of drugs , including the following : Antacids such as Pepto-Bismol , TUMS , or milk of magnesia can be used to neutralize stomach acid .
Changes that could help include : avoiding or limiting alcohol consumption , avoiding spicy , fried , and acidic foods , eating frequent , small meals , reducing stress , avoiding drugs that can irritate the stomach lining , such as NSAIDs or aspirin , .

Abdominal pain can be crampy , achy , dull , intermittent or sharp .
It causes severe , temporary pain .
People with gastritis frequently experience abdominal pain .
Pain is often located in the upper-center part of the abdomen , or in the upper-left portion of the stomach .
Pain will often radiate to the back .
Other common symptoms include bloating and nausea .
Vomiting blood is a symptom of more severe gastritis .
Other symptoms of severe gastritis include shortness of breath , chest pain , severe stomach pain , and foul-smelling bowel movements .
Seek urgent medical evaluation if any of the following symptoms occur : vomiting blood , bringing up excessive amounts of yellow or green vomit , black or bloody bowel movements , abdominal pain with fever , dizziness and fainting , rapid heartbeat , excessive sweating , shortness of breath , .
Stomach bleeding and ulcers can occur in people with gastritis who are yet to be treated .
Both types can develop into anemia .
Ménétrier disease : This disorder is rare and involves the development of thick folds and cysts on the stomach wall.
Risk factors for gastritis include : bacterial infections , especially H. pylori infection , viral , fungal , or parasitic infections , smoking , caffeine intake , excessive alcohol intake , cocaine use , stress , routine use of pain medications , such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications ( NSAIDs ) , regularly taking medications such as prescription steroids , chemotherapy , potassium supplements , and iron , being an older adult , swallowing corrosives or foreign objects , having an autoimmune disorder such as Hashimoto 's disease or type 1 diabetes , vitamin B12 deficiency , HIV , Crohn 's disease , bile reflux after undergoing stomach surgery , a history of chronic vomiting , exposure to radiation , either by radioactive treatment or contamination , food allergies , .
Although many individuals with gastritis may have no symptoms , both acute and chronic gastritis may have symptoms ofabdominal pain , , nausea , , vomiting , and , occasionally , belching , bloating , loss of appetite and indigestion.
Complications from chronic gastritis include peptic ulcer , bleeding ulcers , anemia , gastric cancers , MALT lymphoma , renal problems , strictures , bowel obstruction , or even death.
abdominal pain , , nausea , , vomiting , and , occasionally , belching , bloating , loss of appetite and indigestion.
Symptoms of gastritis include : Upper abdominal pain , Burning , Heartburn , .
Symptoms of chronic gastritis include : Feelings of fullness , Nausea , Intestinal gas , .
This has leads to some confusion and is the reason why many health-care professionals now consider the term gastritis as a non-specific description of a cluster of symptoms .
Indigestion ( dyspepsia ) is another term that encompasses this cluster of symptoms .
Symptoms of severe gastritis may include : Vomiting blood , Blood in the stool , Anemia , .
Complications of gastritis may include peptic ulcer , , bleeding ulcers , , erosive stomach lining ( the stomach tissue wears away ) , anemia , , gastric cancers , , MALT lymphoma , , gastric scarring and strictures with outlet obstruction , , dehydration , , renal problems , and , death.
The prognosis of individuals with chronic disease and those who develop serious complications like bleeding ulcers , obstruction and cancer is more guarded .

H. suis colonization in the pig stomach is associated with chronic gastritis , decreased daily weight gain [ ] and ulcers in the pars oesophagea ( non-glandular stomach ) [ ] .
Here , we observed tumour‐associated TLSs in a preclinical mouse model ( gp130 ) of gastric cancer , where tumourigenesis is dependent on hyperactive STAT3 signalling through the common IL‐6 family signalling receptor , gp130 .
Gastric tumourigenesis was associated with the development of B and T cell‐rich submucosal lymphoid aggregates , containing CD21 cellular networks and high endothelial venules .
Recently , tumour‐associated TLSs were described in GC , and histological evidence of a coordinated local B cell ( CD20 ) and T helper ( Th ) 1 ( T‐bet ) response was associated with improved relapse‐free survival .
At the molecular level , these mice contain a knock‐in phenylalanine mutation at tyrosine 757 in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 , the common IL‐6 family signalling receptor , disrupts the negative feedback imposed on gp130 signalling by suppressor of cytokine signalling ( SOCS ) 3 .
The gp130 mice and their compound mutant derivatives either heterozygous for Stat3 ( gp130 : Stat3± ) or deficient in Il17a ( gp130 : Il17a ) , have been described previously.
Submucosal lymphoid aggregates were characterised in serial sections by immunohistochemistry , using antibodies specific to mouse B220 ( BD Biosciences , UK ) , CD3 ( Dako , Agilent Technologies , UK ) , podoplanin ( BioLegend , UK ) , p‐YSTAT3 ( Cell Signaling Technology , from New England BioLabs , UK ) , CD21 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Germany ) , CXCL13 ( R & D Systems , UK ) , PNAd ( MECA‐79 ) , Bcl‐6 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) and Ki67 ( Abcam , UK ) .
Lymphoid aggregates in human GC biopsies were detected using antibodies against CD20 and CD3 ( both from Dako ) .
( c ) Representative immunohistochemistry of serial sequential sections showing co‐localisation of B220 ( B cells ) and CD3 ( T cells ) at lymphoid aggregates in 6‐month‐old gp130 mice .
( d ) Representative immunohistochemistry of CD21 , PNAd HEV with high‐power image inset , podoplanin ( Pdpn ) and CXCL13 at lymphoid aggregates in 6‐month‐old gp130 mice .
( g ) Dual staining for CD3 ( purple ) and B220 ( brown ) ( left image ) and PNA ( right image ) in sequential sections at lymphoid aggregates in 6‐month‐old gp130 mice .
( a ) Representative immunohistochemistry of T cell ( CD3 ) and B cell ( B220 ) staining of lymphoid aggregates at time points representing pre ( 4‐week old ) , early ( 3‐month old ) and advanced ( 6‐month old ) gastric tumour development in gp130 mice .
[ Color figure can be viewed at ] Cytokines that activate STAT3 have previously been linked with TLS development and maintenance , including IL‐6 , IL‐21 and IL‐22.
Development of tumour‐associated TLSs in gp130 mice is STAT3 driven but is independent of IL‐17 .
H & E and immunohistochemistry for B cells ( B220 ) and T cells ( CD3 ) in tumour‐associated TLSs of 6‐month‐old gp130 ( WT ) , gp130 ( FF ) , gp130 : Stat3 ( FF : St3 ) and gp130 : IL17a ( FF : Il17 ) mice ( representative images from n = 6 gp130 , n = 5 gp130 , n = 4 gp130 : IL17a , n = 4 gp130 : Stat3 ) .
The IL‐6 related cytokine , IL‐27 , also utilises gp130 for signalling .
However while IL‐6 is primarily pro‐inflammatory , IL‐27 can preferentially activate STAT1 to exert suppressive effects on adaptive immune cells .
Amongst the factors associated with treatment failure are high bacterial load , high gastric acidity , Hp strain , smoking , low compliance , overweight , and increasing antibiotic resistance .
A systematic review showed , in AG patients with pernicious anaemia , an estimated 7-fold relative risk of gastric cancer [ ] .
From a gastroenterological perspective , bismuth salts have been used to treat peptic ulcer disease , dyspepsia , parasitic infections , microscopic colitis , and infectious diarrhoea [ ] .
There was also no statistically significant difference in the total number of adverse events between those receiving bismuth salts and other regimens or in the individual adverse events , that is , abdominal pain , diarrhoea , dizziness , headache , metallic taste , nausea or vomiting .
This phenomenon is driven by a range of overarching factors , including endemicity of infections associated with anemia , high prevalence of sickle cell anemia , blood loss linked to accidents , surgical and/or obstetrical emergencies and malnutrition , among others [ ] .
The NBTS-TTI screening department used the following assays : HBsAg ( SD HBs Ag ELISA 3.0 ) , HCV ( SD HCV ELISA 3.0 ) , Syphilis ( MEDIFF TPHA ) and HIV testing ELISA-1 ( Vironostika HIV-1 Plus O Microelisa System ) and ELISA - 2 ( AccuDiag™ HIV 1 & 2 Ag/Ab ELISA Generation ) or Murex HIV Ag/Ab Combination ( ABBOTT Diagnostics Division ) .
Prevalence of anti-HIV , HBsAg , anti-HCV and anti-TP were expressed in percentages per year for specific donor characteristics .
Often referred to as the “ great imitator , ” neurosyphilis can present with various psychiatric symptoms , including psychosis , personality change , delirium , and dementia [ ] .
In addition , he experienced vivid visual hallucinations : he reported having recently seen hundreds of North Korean soldiers in the battlefield at dawn .
Moreover , given that the patient had experienced visual hallucinations , the MMSE may be insufficient for evaluation of cognitive function .

In this study , a set of immunological biomarkers was studied in order to understand protection upon vaccination with yellow fever ( 17DD-YF ) vaccine .
For this purpose , the immunological memory statuses of circulating T- and B-cells along with the plasmatic molecules ( cytokine profile ) were monitored before and at distinct time-points after primary vaccination .
The yellow fever ( YF ) vaccine is a live attenuated virus isolated in the 1930s , which has been considered the most robust and successful vaccine ever developed [ ] .
Decreased levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ produced by CD4 and CD8 T-cells and increased levels of IL-10 CD4 T-cells were found in primary 17DD-YF vaccinees over time [ ] .
Moreover , the percentage of cytokine cells were also quantified amongst CD4 and CD8 T-cells ( TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-10 and IL-5 ) as well as CD19 B-cells ( TNF-α , IL-10 and IL-5 ) .
Expansion of memory CD8 T-cells ( CCR7 , Ki-67 and Bcl-2 ) has been reported following vaccination 17D-YF vaccination as a gradual and continuous process associated with high-quality immune memory observed at early ( 3 month ) and late ( 2 years ) stages [ ] .
The increase of IL-5 produced by CD4 and CD8 T-cells has been already reported at day30 after 17DD-YF primary vaccination [ ] .
A series of outbreaks of yellow fever has triggered the need for a global response .
Recent dengue and Zika epidemics in the Asia–Pacific region indicate the potential risk of the spread of yellow fever to Asian-Pacific countries , ” she says , noting that all three viruses are transmitted to humans by the Aedes aegypti mosquito .
Of the 40 countries covered by the strategy , 16 have implemented preventive mass campaigns and 35 include yellow fever in their routine immunization programmes .
For Tomori , it is not only the weakness of routine yellow fever vaccination that makes Nigeria a priority for the EYE strategy .
The yellow fever and measles vaccines are usually given simultaneously later , when a child is 9 months old , but infants are not always brought back and when they are , often the vaccine has run out .
Although effective vaccines exist against other flaviviral diseases like yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis , dengue vaccine development is complicated by the presence of four virus serotypes and the possibility of partial immunity enhancing dengue disease severity .
As highly effective live attenuated vaccines ( LAVs ) have been developed against other flaviviruses such as yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses , the prospects for a dengue vaccine should be good ( ) .
While various cell types are susceptible to ZIKV infection in interferon ( IFN ) receptor 1-deficient mice ( Ifnar1 ) , ZIKV susceptibility in the testes of wild-type immunocompetent mice has not been systematically evaluated .
To identify testicular cell types permissive for ZIKV , we infected murine testicular cells , GCs , SCs , LCs , and MCs , with ZIKV in vitro ( MR 766 , multiplicity of infection ( MOI ) = 0.1 plaque-forming unit ( PFU ) per cell ) , and stained for ZIKV envelope protein ( ZIKV-E ) and testicular cell markers , DEAD-Box helicase 4 ( DDX4 ) for GCs , SRY-box 9 ( SOX9 ) for SCs , 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ( 17β-HSD ) for LCs , and α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) for MCs .
Mock-infected and ZIKV-infected ( MOI = 0.1 PFU per cell ) GCs ( DDX4 ) , SCs ( SOX9 ) , LCs ( 17β-HSD ) , and MCs ( α-SMA ) immunostaining ( g ) and quantification ( n = 5 , 3 , 5 , and 8 , respectively , for each group ) ( h ) .
ZIKV vRNA was detected in the semen , brain , and seminal vesicles of some vehicle-treated mice , but no BC-treated mice had detectable ZIKV vRNA ( Supplementary Fig . )
Culture medium for the GCs was StemPro-34 SFM ( Gibco , 10640 ) supplemented with StemPro supplement , 1× ( Gibco , 10641 ) ; -glucose , 6 mg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , G8769-100ML ) ; bovine serum albumin , 0.50 % ( Hyclone , G8769-100ML ) ; MEM vitamin solution ( Gibco , 11120-052 ) ; β-estradiol , 30 ng ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , E2758-1G ) ; progesterone , 60 ng ml ( Calbiochem , 5341 ) ; fetal bovine serum , 1 % ( Gibco , 10438026 ) ; antibiotic–antimycotic solution ( Gibco , 15240062 ) ; bovine holo-transferrin , 100 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , T1283-500MG ) ; insulin , 25 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , I9278-5ML ) ; human glial-derived neurotrophic factor , 20 ng ml ( Life , PHC7041 ) ; human basic fibroblast growth factor , 10 ng ml ( Life , PHG0023 ) ; non-essential amino acid solution ( Gibco , 11140-050 ) ; -glutamine , 2 mM ( Gibco , 45000-676 ) ; putrescine , 60 μM ( Sigma-Aldrich , P7505-25G ) ; sodium selenite , 30 nM ( Sigma-Aldrich , 214485-5 G ) ; pyruvic acid , 30 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , 107360-25 G ) ; d ( ) -lactic acid , 1 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , L1250-500ML ) ; β-mercaptoethanol , 50 μM ( Gibco , 21985-023 ) ; ascorbic acid , 100 mM ( Sigma-Aldrich , A4544-25G ) ; -biotin , 10 μg ml ( Sigma-Aldrich , B4639-500MG ) ; and mouse epidermal growth factor , 20 ng ml ( Life , PHG0313 ) .
Reverse transcription was carried out with random hexamer primers or strand-specific tagged primers of ZIKV plus β-actin ( ACTB ) gene-specific primer of human or mouse using High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit ( Thermo Fisher ) .
A useful tool that can help researchers answer this and other related questions is a computational simulator that implements a mathematical model describing the human immune response to vaccination against yellow fever .
The four experiments were : a ) simulation of a scenario in which an individual was vaccinated against yellow fever for the first time ; b ) simulation of a booster dose ten years after the first dose ; c ) simulation of the immune response to the yellow fever vaccine in individuals with different levels of naïve CD8+ T cells ; and d ) simulation of the immune response to distinct doses of the yellow fever vaccine .
Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were mild or moderate in both groups with the exception of a 4-year old girl in Test group with grade 3 fever which resolved without sequelae .
Symptoms include fever , abdominal pain , and nausea , which last between one to four weeks , and 1–2 % of hospitalized cases result in death , .
Improved sanitation contributed to the sharp decline of typhoid fever in industrialized countries during the early 20th century , but such infrastructure is slow to materialize in places where the disease remains endemic , .
Local reactogenicity events ( at the site of injection ) included pain , tenderness , erythema/redness , swelling/induration and pruritus after study vaccine administration .
Tenderness as a solicited reaction was not sought in children as it is difficult to assess in younger participants .
Tenderness was sought in adults and adolescents only .
Solicited systemic AEs included fever , headache , fatigue , arthralgia , myalgia , chills , nausea/vomiting and acute allergic reaction after study vaccine administration .
Tenderness was not elicited in young children but was a common immediate reaction in adolescents with 4.2 % and 16.7 % in Test and Comparator vaccine groups , respectively .
Irrespective of the age and dose , pain and tenderness were the most common solicited AEs reported in both groups .
Pain , tenderness and headache were the most common solicited AEs reported among adults in both groups .
Fever was reported by 3 participants ( 4.2 % ) in Test and 1 ( 1.4 % ) in Comparator groups .
Fever was reported by 4 participants ( 5.9 % ) in Test and 2 ( 2.9 % ) in Comparator groups .
All solicited and unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in intensity in both vaccine groups with the exception of a 4-year old girl in Test group with grade 3 fever that resolved without sequelae .
A similar correlation was observed in a previous study and SBA titers were inversely correlated with susceptibility to typhoid fever .

Those with blood-culture confirmed typhoid fever will be followed up till 90 days to estimate costs and clinical outcomes of the illness episodes .
The burden of enteric fever is predicted to worsen with the emergence of multi-drug resistant strain H58 in this region .
These recommendations have remained unimplemented in India partly due to a perceived decline in the incidence and severity of typhoid fever in recent hospital-based reports accompanied with evidence of heterogeneous distribution of disease .
Active , community-based surveillance will estimate the true incidence of typhoid fever and provide a better understanding of transmission of typhoid in the population than available data from hospital based extrapolations .
A digital thermometer and a fever diary card will be provided , and primary caregivers will be trained to use the thermometer and document the temperature three times a day .
The study team will also document the temperature of the child in the fever diary card during home visits .
At each daily contact during the fever follow up , the study team will document information pertaining to the previous calendar day including the highest documented temperature .
Any reported fever for 3 or more consecutive days will be designated as ‘ Suspected Typhoid Fever ’ and the child will be encouraged to visit the study clinic .
Any subsequent fever within the next 24 h will warrant a blood culture .
We propose a blood culture in those with three or more days of reported fever as the prevalence of antibiotic therapy in those with over 3 days of fever is substantial .

But typically chronic gastritis takes longer to disappear .
And without treatment it may persist for years .
Your doctor may recommend changes to your diet to reduce stomach irritation .
Things to avoid include : a high-salt diet , a high-fat diet , alcohol , including beer , wine , or spirits , a diet high in red meat and preserved meats , .
Recommended foods include : all fruits and vegetables , foods high in probiotics , such as yogurt and kefir , lean meats , such as chicken , turkey , and fish , plant based proteins like beans and tofu , whole grain pasta , rice , and breads , .
Some foods may help your stomach get rid of H. pylori and relieve your symptoms : Garlic may have antimicrobial properties that are especially effective against H. pylori bacteria .
Cranberries may kill the bacteria , along with changing how it interacts with the stomach.
Ginger may block the growth of the bacteria .
Taking probiotics , especially ones that contain Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium , may help improve the function of your stomach lining and protect it against bacteria that causes gastritis .
Foods like kefir , sourdough bread , and yogurt are full of healthy probiotic bacteria .
Your recovery from chronic gastritis depends on the underlying cause of the condition .
If chronic gastritis continues without treatment , your risk of stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding increases .
As gastritis wears away at your stomach lining , the lining weakens and often causes changes in the cells , which can lead to gastric cancer .
Your stomach ’ s inability to absorb vitamins can also cause deficiencies that keep your body from forming red blood cells or affect nerve function .
You can help control the complications of gastritis by monitoring your diet and stress levels .
Limiting alcohol and the use of NSAIDs , like ibuprofen , naproxen , and aspirin may also help to prevent the condition .
