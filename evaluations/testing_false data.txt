your stomach is a muscular sac about the size of a small melon that expands when you eat or drink to hold as much as a gallon of food or liquid . situation is a general term for a group of conditions with one thing in common : inflammation of the lining of the stomach .
regular use of certain pain relievers and drinking too much alcohol also can contribute to situation . situation may occur suddenly ( acute situation ) , or appear slowly over time ( chronic situation ) .
for most people , however , situation is n't serious and improves quickly with treatment . situation is inflammation of the lining of the stomach .
it may occur as a short episode or may be of a long duration .
common causes include infection with helicobacter pylori and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) .
less common causes include alcohol , smoking , cocaine , severe illness , autoimmune problems , radiation therapy and crohn 's disease .
endoscopy , a type of x-ray known as an upper gastrointestinal series , blood tests , and stool tests may help with diagnosis .
prevention is by avoiding things that cause the disease .
treatment includes medications such as antacids , h2 blockers , or proton pump inhibitors .
during an acute attack drinking viscous lidocaine may help .
if situation is due to nsaids these may be stopped .
if h. pylori is present it may be treated with a combination of antibiotics such as amoxicillin and clarithromycin .
people are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them . situation is believed to affect about half of people worldwide .
in 2013 there were approximately 90 million new cases of the condition .
as people get older the disease becomes more common .
it , along with a similar condition in the first part of the intestines known as duodenitis , resulted in 50,000 deaths in 2015 .
h. pylori was first discovered in 1981 by barry marshall and robin warren .
common causes include helicobacter pylori and nsaids .
less common causes include alcohol , cocaine , severe illness and crohn disease , among others .
ulcer disease , stomach cancers , some distinct extragastric disorders ) .
people are usually advised to avoid foods that bother them .
acute erosive situation typically involves discrete foci of surface necrosis due to damage to mucosal defenses .
also , nsaids , such as aspirin , reduce a substance that protects the stomach called prostaglandin .
these drugs used in a short period are not typically dangerous .
however , regular use can lead to situation .
this form of situation can occur in more than 5 % of hospitalized patients .
also , note that alcohol consumption does not cause chronic situation .

however , there are many other causes like other infectious agents , autoimmune problems , diseases like crohn 's disease , sarcoidosis , and isolated granulomatosis situation.
the treatment for situation varies according to the cause .
other less common causes may be treated similarly , but do not treat the underlying cause.
for example : stop cigarette smoking.
avoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.
avoid caffeinated , decaffeinated , and carbonated drinks ; and fruit juices that contain citric acid , for example , grapefruit , orange , pineapple , etc.
avoid high-fat foods.
complications from acute situation are rare.
people with acute situation usually recover completely with no complications.
chronic situation may have a range of outcomes from good ( early treatment ) to poor if serious complications develop.
if underlying causes of situation ( for example , alcohol , or nsaids usage ) are treated or not used , situation also may be prevented.
to prevent infectious causes of situation practice good hand washing techniques , for example , wash the hands thoroughly and frequently.
to reduce the risk of situation avoid situations where you are exposed to chemicals , radiation , or toxins. situation possible to cure in many patients if the underlying cause ( s ) is cured.
stop cigarette smoking.
certain teas , onions , garlic , berries , celery , kale , broccoli , parsley , thyme , soy foods , legumes , . situation , or inflammation of the lining tissues of the stomach , can be either acute or chronic . situation is inflammation of the lining of the stomach .
unfortunately , the term situation has been misused to include many different upper abdominal problems , but true situation refers to the stomach lining ( gastric mucosa ) that is inflamed .
all or part of the gastric mucosa may be involved . situation may be classified as acute or chronic .
acute situation maybe characterized as erosive ( damaged areas where mucosal cells are disrupted or missing ) and nonerosive.
there is no widely accepted classification system although some have been proposed.
this article will focus on true situation .
readers comments 41 , share your story , .
acute situation lasts for about 2-10 days .
chronic situation , if untreated , may last from weeks to years .
if the underlying cause of situation ( for example , alcohol drinking ) is untreated , then the situation it causes will likely continue .
moreover , stress reduction is also recommended .

a major cause of both acute and chronic situation is infection of the stomach mucosa by a bacterial species named helicobacter pylori .
this infection generates an initial strong inflammatory response and eventually , a long-term chronic inflammation with intestinal cell changes may develop .
another major cause of acute and chronic situation is the use ( and overuse ) of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) .
in general , infectious agents , especially helicobacter pylori , and nsaids are responsible for the majority of people with situation .
readers comments 3 , share your story , .
definitive diagnosis of situation is made by identifying the underlying cause of the gastric mucosal inflammation and/or by tissue ( gastric ) biopsy .
for example , the major infective cause of situation is helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) .
this bacterium can be detected by breath , blood , stool , immunological and biopsy tests .
although the bacterium can be cultured from the patient , this is seldom attempted .
other pathogens can be identified using culture , stool , and immunological tests .
abdominal x-rays or barium studies ( upper or lower ) may demonstrate the presence of thickened mucosa and folds that are signs of inflammation in the stomach .
treatments for situation vary and depend on successful treatments of its underlying cause ( s ) .
a diet that avoids hot , fried and/or spicy foods , alcohol drinking , or eating items you may be allergic to is another good way to both treat and reduce the risk of situation .
however , home remedies usually do not treat the underlying cause of the condition .
readers comments 6 , share your story , .
if nsaids are the cause , then stopping the drug should be effective .
they all function by different mechanisms to reduce acid in the stomach but usually do not treat the underlying cause of situation .
those people with underlying causes that are appropriately treated often recover completely .
if the underlying cause of situation is preventable , then situation can be prevented and people can get situation relief .
if alcohol consumption , nsaids , or smoking causes an individual 's situation , treatment and prevention is stopping the consumption or use of these products.
avoid situations where chemicals , radiation or some toxin ingestion could occur.

it does , however , erode the mucosal lining of the stomach ; low doses of alcohol stimulate hydrochloric acid secretion .
high doses of alcohol do not stimulate secretion of acid .
chronic situation refers to a wide range of problems of the gastric tissues .
the immune system makes proteins and antibodies that fight infections in the body to maintain a homeostatic condition .
in some disorders the body targets the stomach as if it were a foreign protein or pathogen ; it makes antibodies against , severely damages , and may even destroy the stomach or its lining . situation may also be caused by other medical conditions , including hiv/aids , crohn 's disease , certain connective tissue disorders , and liver or kidney failure .
since 1992 , chronic situation lesions are classified according to the sydney system .
intestinal metaplasia typically begins in response to chronic mucosal injury in the antrum , and may extend to the body .
gastric mucosa cells change to resemble intestinal mucosa and may even assume absorptive characteristics .
intestinal metaplasia is classified histologically as complete or incomplete .
with complete metaplasia , gastric mucosa is completely transformed into small-bowel mucosa , both histologically and functionally , with the ability to absorb nutrients and secrete peptides .
in incomplete metaplasia , the epithelium assumes a histologic appearance closer to that of the large intestine and frequently exhibits dysplasia .

antacids are a common treatment for mild to medium situation .
when antacids do not provide enough relief , medications such as h2 blockers and proton-pump inhibitors that help reduce the amount of acid are often prescribed .
cytoprotective agents are designed to help protect the tissues that line the stomach and small intestine .
they include the medications sucralfate and misoprostol .
if nsaids are being taken regularly , one of these medications to protect the stomach may also be taken .
another cytoprotective agent is bismuth subsalicylate .
several regimens are used to treat h. pylori infection .
most use a combination of two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor .
sometimes bismuth is added to the regimen .

nearly everyone has had a bout of indigestion and stomach irritation .
tell your doctor if your stomach discomfort occurs after taking prescription or over-the-counter drugs , especially aspirin or other pain relievers .
if you are vomiting blood , have blood in your stools or have stools that appear black , see your doctor right away to determine the cause . situation is an inflammation of the stomach lining .
weaknesses or injury to the mucus-lined barrier that protects your stomach wall allows your digestive juices to damage and inflame your stomach lining .
a number of diseases and conditions can increase your risk of situation , including crohn 's disease and sarcoidosis , a condition in which collections of inflammatory cells grow in the body .
factors that increase your risk of situation include : bacterial infection .
doctors believe vulnerability to the bacterium could be inherited or could be caused by lifestyle choices , such as smoking and diet.
regular use of pain relievers .
common pain relievers — such as aspirin , ibuprofen ( advil , motrin ib , others ) and naproxen ( aleve , anaprox ) — can cause both acute situation and chronic situation .
using these pain relievers regularly or taking too much of these drugs may reduce a key substance that helps preserve the protective lining of your stomach.
older age .
excessive alcohol use .
alcohol can irritate and erode your stomach lining , which makes your stomach more vulnerable to digestive juices .
excessive alcohol use is more likely to cause acute situation.
your own body attacking cells in your stomach .
called autoimmune situation , this type of situation occurs when your body attacks the cells that make up your stomach lining .
this reaction can wear away at your stomach 's protective barrier .
autoimmune situation is more common in people with other autoimmune disorders , including hashimoto 's disease and type 1 diabetes .
autoimmune situation can also be associated with vitamin b-12 deficiency.
other diseases and conditions . situation may be associated with other medical conditions , including hiv/aids , crohn 's disease and parasitic infections.
autoimmune situation can also be associated with vitamin b-12 deficiency .
rarely , some forms of chronic situation may increase your risk of stomach cancer , especially if you have extensive thinning of the stomach lining and changes in the lining 's cells .
it 's not clear how h. pylori spreads , but there 's some evidence that it could be transmitted from person to person or through contaminated food and water .
you can take steps to protect yourself from infections , such as h. pylori , by frequently washing your hands with soap and water and by eating foods that have been cooked completely .

it can occur suddenly ( acute ) or gradually ( chronic ) .
bile reflux : a backflow of bile into the stomach from the bile tract ( that connects to the liver and gallbladder ) , infections caused by bacteria and viruses , .
if situation is left untreated , it can lead to a severe loss of blood and may increase the risk of developing stomach cancer .
to diagnose situation , your doctor will review your personal and family medical history , perform a thorough physical evaluation , and may recommend any of the following tests : upper endoscopy .
an endoscope , a thin tube containing a tiny camera , is inserted through your mouth and down into your stomach to look at the stomach lining .
the doctor will check for inflammation and may perform a biopsy , a procedure in which a tiny sample of tissue is removed and then sent to a laboratory for analysis.
blood tests .
the doctor may perform various blood tests , such as checking your red blood cell count to determine whether you have anemia , which means that you do not have enough red blood cells .
he or she can also screen for h. pylori infection and pernicious anemia with blood tests.
fecal occult blood test ( stool test ) .
this test checks for the presence of blood in your stool , a possible sign of situation.

chronic situation , however , may stay in the body unnoticed but complicate later on .
the helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) bacteria is one of the main causes of situation and is thought to be present in 50 percent of the global population . situation can increase the risk of other gastrointestinal conditions , such as stomach ulcers and cancer.
people with situation typically report sharp , stabbing , or burning pains in the upper-center or upper-left part of the abdomen.
the two main types of situation are erosive and nonerosive .
erosive situation wears down the stomach lining , and nonerosive situation causes change to the stomach lining.
smokers and people who regularly use pain medications are at risk of situation.
people with situation should eat celery , apples , and honey .
herbal teas are also safe to drink .
avoid caffeinated beverages , dairy produce , and spicy foods.
a range of medications is available to treat situation , including antibiotics and antacids.
in cases of situation involving vomiting , the appearance of the vomit may be clear , yellow , or green .
the vomit may also contain blood .
chronic situation can sometimes increase the risk of developing stomach growths and tumors .
certain types of situation , including autoimmune atrophic situation and h. pylori situation , can reduce the effectiveness of the body 's ability to absorb iron from blood .
in autoimmune atrophic situation , this can also affect vitamin b12 absorption .
there are different causes and types of situation . situation happens after a weakening of the protective mucus lining of the stomach .
digestive juices can then damage and inflame the walls of the stomach .
there are two main types of situation .
an example is acute stress situation , which follows changes due to critical illness .
erosive situation usually has a quick onset , but this may take longer with chronic situation.
the most common cause of situation is h. pylori infection in the stomach lining .
there are other types that result from trauma or damage to the stomach lining .
one example of this is postgastrectomy situation , where the stomach lining degenerates after the removal of part of the stomach .
it is not known how this occurs .
it is thought that gastrectomy may cause increased reflux , reactions from the vagal nerve , or reduction in the number of acids triggered by hormones .
others types include : infectious situation not caused by h. pylori : viruses or fungi can cause situation in people with immune difficulties or long-term illnesses.
radiation situation : exposure of the abdominal area to radiation can irritate the stomach lining.
eosinophilic situation : this form of situation can occur due to an allergic reaction .
the cause of the allergic reaction is not known.
it is not currently known how situation spreads .
contaminated food , water , or cutlery are thought to play a part in transferring h. pylori from one person to the next .
however , the wide range of causes makes this difficult to confirm .
certain people are at a higher risk for developing situation .
there are many conditions and lifestyle factors that can increase the chances of inflammation in the stomach lining .
other infections that can increase the risk of situation include tuberculosis and syphilis .
in some cases , situation will be diagnosed with x-rays of the esophagus , stomach , and small intestine .
these x-rays are sometimes referred to as an upper gastrointestinal series or a barium swallow .
barium is a white , metallic liquid that is sometimes swallowed before a scan to help highlight any abnormalities .
a doctor may also request : blood tests , urine tests , evaluations of kidney and liver function , checks for anemia , gallbladder and pancreas function tests , pregnancy tests , stool evaluation , .
using this range of checks will allow a doctor to diagnose situation .
if these tests are inconclusive , a doctor may perform an upper endoscopy .
this involves the insertion of a thin , flexible , illuminated viewing tube into the abdomen through the mouth to look at the stomach .
while these measures alone are unlikely to cure the condition , they can provide vital support to active situation treatment .
both broccoli sprouts and probiotic yogurt have demonstrated helpful effects that counter h. pylori .
however , there remains no concrete evidence that broccoli sprouts reliably keep situation at bay .
probiotic yogurt has shown great promise as a supporting treatment alongside antibiotics , but more research is required to confirm this .
some studies have shown that probiotics help to clear out infection .
rather than looking for foods to resolve the infection , it is best to eat foods that do not further inflame the infection .
when adjusting the diet during a case of situation , be sure of the following : eat 5 to 6 small meals a day , as this can reduce the impact of stomach acids.
hydrate often by frequently consuming water.
add omega-3 supplements to the diet , as they may play a role in resolving situation.
there is no single diet that will cure situation .
however , embracing the dietary changes that soothe inflammation can support a treatment regimen .
the foods consumed are an important part of situation treatment .
treatment for situation is dependent on several factors .
these include the cause of the condition and whether the presentation of situation is acute or chronic .
regimens may include clarithromycin and metronidazole.
proton pump inhibitors : these include omeprazole and lansoprazole .
proton pump inhibitors block the production of acid and aid healing.
antacids : these can neutralize stomach acid.
coating agents : sucralfate or misoprostol can coat and protect the stomach lining.
the treatment depends on the cause .
for example , if the cause of situation is not bacterial , antibiotics will have no effect .
combining these treatments with the recommended dietary changes is the surest way to tackle situation .
a person can reduce the risk of developing situation by following these steps : practice good hand-washing hygiene and eat well-cooked food .
this reduces the risk of contracting h. pylori .
avoid certain medications , smoking , caffeine , and alcohol.
as some causes are unknown , there is no way to fully prevent situation .

everything you need to know about situation .
your stomach lining , or mucosa , has glands that produce stomach acid and other important compounds .
one example is the enzyme pepsin .
while your stomach acid breaks down food and protects you from infection , pepsin breaks down protein .
the acid in your stomach is strong enough to damage your stomach .
so , your stomach lining secretes mucus to protect itself .
chronic situation occurs when your stomach lining becomes inflamed .
when inflammation occurs , your stomach lining changes and loses some of its protective cells .
it may also cause early satiety .
this is where your stomach feels full after eating just a few bites of food .
because chronic situation occurs over a long period of time it gradually wears away at your stomach lining .
and it can cause metaplasia or dysplasia .
these are precancerous changes in your cells that can lead to cancer if untreated .
chronic situation usually gets better with treatment , but may need ongoing monitoring .
several types of chronic situation exist , and they can have different causes : type a is caused by your immune system destroying stomach cells .
type b , the most common type , is caused by helicobacter pylori bacteria , and can cause stomach ulcers , intestinal ulcers , and cancer .
type c is caused by chemical irritants like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) , alcohol , or bile .
and it can also cause stomach lining erosion and bleeding.
there is also eosinophilic situation , which can happen alongside other allergic conditions like asthma or eczema .
your risk for chronic situation increases if your lifestyle and dietary habits activate changes in the stomach lining .
it may be useful to avoid : high-fat diet , high-salt diet , smoking , .
long-term consumption of alcohol can also lead to chronic situation .
a stressful lifestyle or a traumatic experience can also decrease your stomach ’ s ability to protect itself .
in addition , your risk increases if you have autoimmune diseases or certain illnesses like crohn ’ s disease .
stomach irritation is common , but it isn ’ t always a symptom of chronic situation .
also seek treatment right away if you have black stools , vomit anything that looks like coffee grounds , or have a persistent stomachache .
learn more : endoscopy » medications and diet are the most common ways of treating chronic situation .
and treatment for each type focuses on the cause of the situation .
if you have type a , your doctor will likely address the problems related to the nutrients you are lacking .
if you have type b , your doctor will use antimicrobial agents and acid blocking medications to destroy h. pylori bacteria .
if you have type c , your doctor will likely tell you to stop taking nsaids or drinking alcohol to prevent further damage to your stomach .
reducing or eliminating aspirin and similar medicines is recommended to decrease stomach irritation .
your doctor should be aware of any supplements you take .
the outlook for acute situation depends on the underlying cause .
it usually resolves quickly with treatment .
h. pylori infections , for example , can often be treated with one or two rounds of antibiotics , and it may take a week or two for you to fight off viral infections .
however , sometimes treatment fails and it can turn into chronic , or long-term , situation .
chronic situation also may increase your risk of developing gastric cancer .
you can reduce your risk of developing this condition with a few simple steps : wash your hands with soap and water regularly and before meals .
this can reduce your risk of becoming infected with h .
cook foods thoroughly .
this also reduces the risk of infection.
avoid alcohol or limit your alcohol intake.
avoid nsaids or don ’ t use them frequently .
consume nsaids with food and water to avoid symptoms.

things to avoid include : a high-salt diet , a high-fat diet , alcohol , including beer , wine , or spirits , a diet high in red meat and preserved meats , .
cranberries may kill the bacteria , along with changing how it interacts with the stomach.
ginger may block the growth of the bacteria .
taking probiotics , especially ones that contain lactobacillus or bifidobacterium , may help improve the function of your stomach lining and protect it against bacteria that causes situation .
foods like kefir , sourdough bread , and yogurt are full of healthy probiotic bacteria .
your recovery from chronic situation depends on the underlying cause of the condition .
if chronic situation continues without treatment , your risk of stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding increases .
limiting alcohol and the use of nsaids , like ibuprofen , naproxen , and aspirin may also help to prevent the condition .

while the prevalence of chronic situation has decreased in developing countries in recent years , acute situation is still common .
this allows digestive acids to irritate the stomach .
there are many things that can damage your stomach lining .
nsaids and corticosteroids ( steroid hormone medications ) are the most common causes of acute situation .
h. pylori is a type of bacteria that can infect the stomach .
other people may have symptoms that range from mild to severe .
it can be difficult to confirm acute situation without talking to a doctor .
if you vomit blood , seek medical attention immediately .
some tests can be used to diagnose acute situation .
some cases of acute situation go away without treatment , and eating a bland diet can aid in a quick recovery .
foods that are low in natural acids , low in fat , and low in fiber may be tolerated best .
h. pylori infections may require one or two rounds of antibiotics , which could last for two weeks apiece .
some treatment options include : there are both over-the-counter and prescription medicines for situation .
these can be used as long as a person experiences situation , with a dose taken as often as every 30 minutes if needed .
proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole ( prilosec ) and esomeprazole ( nexium ) inhibit the production of stomach acid .
they should be taken only once every 24 hours and for no more than 14 days .
antibiotics are only necessary if you have a bacterial infection , such as from h. pylori .
common antibiotics used to treat h. pylori infections include amoxicillin , tetracycline ( which shouldn ’ t be used in children under 12 years old ) , and clarithromycin .
the antibiotic may be used in conjunction with a proton pump inhibitor , antacid , or h2 antagonist .
treatment typically lasts between 10 days and four weeks .
however , don ’ t stop taking these drugs without first talking to your doctor .
according to research originally published in the original internist , certain herbs improve digestive health .
they may also help kill h. pylori .
some herbs may interact with other medications .
but typically chronic gastritis takes longer to disappear .
recommended foods include : all fruits and vegetables , foods high in probiotics , such as yogurt and kefir , lean meats , such as chicken , turkey , and fish , plant based proteins like beans and tofu , whole grain pasta , rice , and breads , .
some foods may help your stomach get rid of h. pylori and relieve your symptoms : garlic may have antimicrobial properties that are especially effective against h. pylori bacteria .
taking probiotics , especially ones that contain lactobacillus or bifidobacterium , may help improve the function of your stomach lining and protect it against bacteria that causes gastritis .
your recovery from chronic gastritis depends on the underlying cause of the condition .
if chronic gastritis continues without treatment , your risk of stomach ulcers and stomach bleeding increases .
as gastritis wears away at your stomach lining , the lining weakens and often causes changes in the cells , which can lead to gastric cancer .
your stomach ’ s inability to absorb vitamins can also cause deficiencies that keep your body from forming red blood cells or affect nerve function .
you can help control the complications of gastritis by monitoring your diet and stress levels .

yellow fever begins after an incubation period of three to six days .
since the 1980s , the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing .
in 2013 , yellow fever resulted in about 127,000 severe infections and 45,000 deaths , with nearly 90 % of these occurring in african nations .
in areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon , early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population are important to prevent outbreaks .
