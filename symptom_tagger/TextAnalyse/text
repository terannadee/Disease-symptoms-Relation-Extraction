  1.        Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with the Plasmodium parasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans: Plasmodium vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. falciparum. P. falciparum causes a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria. Malaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through:an organ transplant a transfusion

            The symptoms of malaria typically develop within 10 days to four weeks following the infection. In some cases, symptoms may not develop for several months. Some malarial parasites can enter the body but will be dormant for long periods of time. Common symptoms of malaria include:

            shaking chills that can range from moderate to severe,
            high fever,
            profuse sweating,
            headache,
            nausea,
            vomiting,
            abdominal pain,
            diarrhea,
            anemia,
            muscle pain,
            convulsions,
            coma,
            bloody stools,

            Your doctor will be able to diagnose malaria. During your appointment, your doctor will review your health history, including any recent travel to tropical climates. A physical exam will also be performed. Your doctor will be able to determine if you have an enlarged spleen or liver. If you have symptoms of malaria, your doctor may order additional blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests will show:

            whether you have malaria
            what type of malaria you have
            if your infection is caused by a parasite that’s resistant to certain types of drugs
            if the disease has caused anemia
            if the disease has affected your vital organs
            Life-threatening complications of malaria
            Malaria can cause a number of life-threatening complications. The following may occur:

            swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, or cerebral malaria an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that causes breathing problems, or pulmonary edema organ failure of the kidneys, liver, or spleen anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells
            Malaria can be a life-threatening condition, especially if you have P. falciparum. Treatment for the disease is typically provided in a hospital. Your doctor will prescribe medications based on the type of parasite that you have. In some instances, the medication prescribed may not clear the infection because of parasite resistance to drugs. If this occurs, your doctor may need to use more than one medication or change medications altogether to treat your condition. Additionally, certain types of malaria, such as P. vivax and P. ovale, have liver stages where the parasite can live in your body for an extended period of time and reactivate at a later date causing a relapse of the infection. If you are found to have one of these types of malaria, you will be given a second medication to prevent a relapse in the future.


  2.        Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus.[1] Symptoms typically begin three to fourteen days after infection.[2] This may include a high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a characteristic skin rash.[1][2] Recovery generally takes two to seven days.[1] In a small proportion of cases, the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage, or into dengue shock syndrome, where dangerously low blood pressure occurs.[2]

            Dengue is spread by several species of mosquito of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti.[1] The virus has five different types;[7][8] infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others.[1] Subsequent infection with a different type increases the risk of severe complications.[1] A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.[2]

            A vaccine for dengue fever has been approved and is commercially available in a number of countries.[4] Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites.[1] This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body.[1] Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease.[2] For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required.[2] About half a million people require admission to hospital a year.[1] Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is recommended instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fever reduction and pain relief in dengue due to an increased risk of bleeding from NSAID use.[2][9][10]

            Dengue has become a global problem since the Second World War and is common in more than 110 countries.[11][12] Each year between 50 and 528 million people are infected and approximately 10,000 to 20,000 die.[13][5][6][14] The earliest descriptions of an outbreak date from 1779.[12] Its viral cause and spread were understood by the early 20th century.[15] Apart from eliminating the mosquitoes, work is ongoing for medication targeted directly at the virus.[16] It is classified as a neglected tropical disease.[17]


  3.        Chickenpox, also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV).[3] The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over.[1] It usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads to the rest of the body.[1] Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches.[1] Symptoms usually last five to seven days.[1] Complications may occasionally include pneumonia, inflammation of the brain, and bacterial skin infections.[6] The disease is often more severe in adults than in children.[7] Symptoms begin 10 to 21 days after exposure to the virus.[2]

            Chickenpox is an airborne disease which spreads easily through the coughs and sneezes of an infected person.[2] It may be spread from one to two days before the rash appears until all lesions have crusted over.[2] It may also spread through contact with the blisters.[2] Those with shingles may spread chickenpox to those who are not immune through contact with the blisters.[2] The disease can usually be diagnosed based on the presenting symptom;[8] however, in unusual cases it may be confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the blister fluid or scabs.[7] Testing for antibodies may be done to determine if a person is or is not immune.[7] People usually only get chickenpox once.[2] Although reinfections by the virus occur, these reinfections usually do not cause any symptoms.[9]

            The varicella vaccine has resulted in a decrease in the number of cases and complications from the disease.[4] It protects about 70 to 90 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease.[7] Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries.[10] Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children.[11] Treatment of those infected may include calamine lotion to help with itching, keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers.[2] For those at increased risk of complications, antiviral medication such as aciclovir are recommended.[2]

            Chickenpox occurs in all parts of the world.[7] In 2013 there were 140 million cases of chickenpox and herpes zoster worldwide.[12] Before routine immunization the number of cases occurring each year was similar to the number of people born.[7] Since immunization the number of infections in the United States has decreased nearly 90%.[7] In 2015 chickenpox resulted in 6,400 deaths globally – down from 8,900 in 1990.[5][13] Death occurs in about 1 per 60,000 cases.[7] Chickenpox was not separated from smallpox until the late 19th century.[7] In 1888 its connection to shingles was determined.[7] The first documented use of the term chicken pox was in 1658.[14] Various explanations have been suggested for the use of "chicken" in the name, one being the relative mildness of the disease.[14]


  4.        Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body.[2][8] These contrast with benign tumors, which do not spread to other parts of the body.[8] Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements.[1] While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes.[1] Over 100 types of cancers affect humans.[8]

            Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths.[2] Another 10% are due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity or excessive drinking of alcohol.[2][9][10] Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants.[3] In the developing world, 15% of cancers are due to infections such as Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human papillomavirus infection, Epstein–Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[2] These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell.[11] Typically, many genetic changes are required before cancer develops.[11] Approximately 5–10% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents.[12] Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests.[2] It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy.[13]

            Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat and avoiding too much sunlight exposure.[14][15] Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer.[16] The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial.[16][17] Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy and targeted therapy.[2][4] Pain and symptom management are an important part of care.[2] Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease.[2] The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment.[11] In children under 15 at diagnosis, the five-year survival rate in the developed world is on average 80%.[18] For cancer in the United States, the average five-year survival rate is 66%.[5]

            In 2015, about 90.5 million people had cancer.[6] About 14.1 million new cases occur a year (not including skin cancer other than melanoma).[11] It caused about 8.8 million deaths (15.7% of deaths).[7] The most common types of cancer in males are lung cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and stomach cancer.[19] In females, the most common types are breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer and cervical cancer.[11] If skin cancer other than melanoma were included in total new cancer cases each year, it would account for around 40% of cases.[20][21] In children, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and brain tumors are most common, except in Africa where non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurs more often.[18] In 2012, about 165,000 children under 15 years of age were diagnosed with cancer.[19] The risk of cancer increases significantly with age, and many cancers occur more commonly in developed countries.[11] Rates are increasing as more people live to an old age and as lifestyle changes occur in the developing world.[22] The financial costs of cancer were estimated at $1.16 trillion USD per year as of 2010.[23]


   5.         Arthritis is a term often used to mean any disorder that affects joints.[2] Symptoms generally include joint pain and stiffness.[2] Other symptoms may include redness, warmth, swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joints.[2][3] In some types other organs are also affected.[6] Onset can be gradual or sudden.[5]

            There are over 100 types of arthritis.[4][5] The most common forms are osteoarthritis (degenerative joint disease) and rheumatoid arthritis.[6] Osteoarthritis usually occurs with age and affects the fingers, knees, and hips.[6] Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that often affects the hands and feet.[6] Other types include gout, lupus, fibromyalgia, and septic arthritis.[6][8] They are all types of rheumatic disease.[2]

            Treatment may include resting the joint and alternating between applying ice and heat.[6] Weight loss and exercise may also be useful.[6] Pain medications such as ibuprofen and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used.[7] In some a joint replacement may be useful.[6]

            Osteoarthritis affects more than 3.8% of people while rheumatoid arthritis affects about 0.24% of people.[9] Gout affects about 1–2% of the Western population at some point in their lives.[10] In Australia about 15% of people are affected,[11] while in the United States more than 20% have a type of arthritis.[8][12] Overall the disease becomes more common with age.[8] Arthritis is a common reason that people miss work and can result in a decreased quality of life.[7] The term is derived from arthr- (meaning joint) and -itis (meaning inflammation).[13][14]


  6.        Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).[9][10][11] Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness.[5] Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms.[6] As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of developing common infections such as tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems.[5] These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).[6] This stage is often also associated with unintended weight loss.[6]

            HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding.[12] Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV.[13] Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision.[5] Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication.[5] There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy.[6][7] Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made.[14] Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years.[15]

            In 2016, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1 million deaths.[16] There were 300,000 fewer new HIV cases in 2016 than in 2015.[17] Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa.[5] From the time AIDS was identified in the early 1980s to 2017, the disease has caused an estimated 35 million deaths worldwide.[18] HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemic—a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading.[19] HIV originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century.[20] AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1981 and its cause—HIV infection—was identified in the early part of the decade.[21]

            HIV/AIDS has had a great impact on society, both as an illness and as a source of discrimination.[22] The disease also has large economic impacts.[22] There are many misconceptions about HIV/AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non-sexual contact.[23] The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic Church's position not to support condom use as prevention.[24] It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large-scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s.[25]

  7.        Ebola virus disease (EVD), also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF) or simply Ebola, is a viral hemorrhagic fever of humans and other primates caused by ebolaviruses.[1] Signs and symptoms typically start between two days and three weeks after contracting the virus with a fever, sore throat, muscular pain, and headaches.[1] Vomiting, diarrhea and rash usually follow, along with decreased function of the liver and kidneys.[1] At this time, some people begin to bleed both internally and externally.[1] The disease has a high risk of death, killing between 25 and 90 percent of those infected, with an average of about 50 percent.[1] This is often due to low blood pressure from fluid loss, and typically follows six to sixteen days after symptoms appear.[2]

            The virus spreads through direct contact with body fluids, such as blood from infected humans or other animals.[1] Spread may also occur from contact with items recently contaminated with bodily fluids.[1] Spread of the disease through the air between primates, including humans, has not been documented in either laboratory or natural conditions.[3] Semen or breast milk of a person after recovery from EVD may carry the virus for several weeks to months.[1][4][5] Fruit bats are believed to be the normal carrier in nature, able to spread the virus without being affected by it.[1] Other diseases such as malaria, cholera, typhoid fever, meningitis and other viral hemorrhagic fevers may resemble EVD.[1] Blood samples are tested for viral RNA, viral antibodies or for the virus itself to confirm the diagnosis.[1]

            Control of outbreaks requires coordinated medical services and community engagement.[1] This includes rapid detection, contact tracing of those who have been exposed, quick access to laboratory services, care for those infected, and proper disposal of the dead through cremation or burial.[1][6] Samples of body fluids and tissues from people with the disease should be handled with special caution.[1] Prevention includes limiting the spread of disease from infected animals to humans by handling potentially infected bushmeat only while wearing protective clothing, and by thoroughly cooking bushmeat before eating it.[1] It also includes wearing proper protective clothing and washing hands when around a person with the disease.[1] No specific treatment or vaccine for the virus is available, although a number of potential treatments are being studied.[1] Supportive efforts, however, improve outcomes.[1] This includes either oral rehydration therapy (drinking slightly sweetened and salty water) or giving intravenous fluids as well as treating symptoms.[1]

            The disease was first identified in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks, one in Nzara, and the other in Yambuku, a village near the Ebola River from which the disease takes its name.[7] EVD outbreaks occur intermittently in tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa.[1] Between 1976 and 2013, the World Health Organization reports a total of 24 outbreaks involving 1,716 cases.[1][8] The largest outbreak to date was the epidemic in West Africa, which occurred from December 2013 to January 2016 with 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths.[9][10][11] It was declared no longer an emergency on 29 March 2016.[12] Other outbreaks in Africa began in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in May 2017,[13][14] and 2018.[15]

  8.        Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus.[1] Symptoms can be mild to severe.[4] The most common symptoms include: a high fever, runny nose, sore throat, muscle pains, headache, coughing, and feeling tired.[1] These symptoms typically begin two days after exposure to the virus and most last less than a week.[1] The cough, however, may last for more than two weeks.[1] In children, there may be nausea and vomiting, but these are not common in adults.[5] Nausea and vomiting occur more commonly in the unrelated infection gastroenteritis, which is sometimes inaccurately referred to as "stomach flu" or the "24-hour flu".[5] Complications of influenza may include viral pneumonia, secondary bacterial pneumonia, sinus infections, and worsening of previous health problems such as asthma or heart failure.[2][4]

            Three types of influenza viruses affect people, called Type A, Type B, and Type C.[2] Usually, the virus is spread through the air from coughs or sneezes.[1] This is believed to occur mostly over relatively short distances.[6] It can also be spread by touching surfaces contaminated by the virus and then touching the mouth or eyes.[4][6] A person may be infectious to others both before and during the time they are showing symptoms.[4] The infection may be confirmed by testing the throat, sputum, or nose for the virus.[2] A number of rapid tests are available; however, people may still have the infection if the results are negative.[2] A type of polymerase chain reaction that detects the virus's RNA is more accurate.[2]

            Frequent hand washing reduces the risk of viral spread.[3] Wearing a surgical mask is also useful.[3] Yearly vaccinations against influenza are recommended by the World Health Organization for those at high risk.[1] The vaccine is usually effective against three or four types of influenza.[1] It is usually well tolerated.[1] A vaccine made for one year may not be useful in the following year, since the virus evolves rapidly.[1] Antiviral drugs such as the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir, among others, have been used to treat influenza.[1] Their benefits in those who are otherwise healthy do not appear to be greater than their risks.[7] No benefit has been found in those with other health problems.[7][8]

            Influenza spreads around the world in a yearly outbreak, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths.[1] In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year.[1] Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems.[1] Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent.[2] In the 20th century, three influenza pandemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (one million deaths).[9] The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009.[10] Influenza may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses, and birds.[11]
            Symptoms of influenza can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection. Usually the first symptoms are chills and body aches, but fever is also common early in the infection, with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39 °C (approximately 100 to 103 °F).[15] Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days, with aches and pains throughout their bodies, which are worse in their backs and legs.[16]

            Fever and chills
            Cough
            Nasal congestion
            Runny nose
            Sneezing
            Sore throat
            Hoarseness
            Ear pressure
            Earache
            Muscle aches
            Fatigue
            Headache
            Irritated, watering eyes
            Reddened eyes, skin (especially face), mouth, throat and nose
            Petechial rash[17]
            In children, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain,[18][19] (may be severe in children with influenza B)[20]
            It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and influenza in the early stages of these infections.[21] Influenza is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia, body ache, headache, and fatigue. Diarrhea is not normally a symptom of influenza in adults,[12] although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 "bird flu"[22] and can be a symptom in children.[18] The symptoms most reliably seen in influenza are shown in the adjacent table.[12]

            Since antiviral drugs are effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy.[23] Two decision analysis studies[24][25] suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%,[25] and thus patients with any of these combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. Even in the absence of a local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.[25]

            The available laboratory tests for influenza continue to improve. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests.[26] According to the CDC, rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 50–75% and specificity of 90–95% when compared with viral culture.[27]

            Occasionally, influenza can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia.[28][29] The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, if a child (or presumably an adult) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever, that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.[30]

            Sometimes, influenza may have abnormal presentations, like confusion in the elderly and a sepsis-like syndrome in the young.[31] Encephalitis due to the flu is rare but not unheard of. One patient and his sibling had a fever, severe diarrhea, and lowering consciousness, followed by seizures and a coma and eventually death without any respiratory disease.[32] One elderly man had confusion, a steadily lowering Glasgow Coma Scale, and soon a coma. He survived, but he had residual neurological symptoms like paraplegia and urinary incontinence.[33]
